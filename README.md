# Important notice

Although I had released this project as a mobile app on Google Play, where it was available for several years, it has recently been suspended due to Google policy changes. 

This app was originally developed as a beginner project to learn more about both Java and the Android development framework. I believe that my coding skills have progressed significantly since then, and the project does no longer meet my standards of quality. However, to bring it up to those standards, a complete rewrite would be necessary - a task that I am not interested in pursuing at this point in my career (in the hope of avoiding the [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)).

Still, the app was moderately popular among the Fire Emblem community, and had received +10K downloads. I have also been requested to make it publicly available again, so I have decided to keep the code open-source and accessible here for anyone interested.

Feel free to use, modify, or learn from the code, but please be aware that no further updates or maintenance will be provided.

Thank you for your understanding and support!
