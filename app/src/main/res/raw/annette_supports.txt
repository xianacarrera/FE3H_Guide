3_41_Annette: Hello, Professor. Do you have a moment?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Of course.\nChoice 2: What do you need?\nAnnette: Well, I have this book of battle tactics that I borrowed from one of the knights. There's one part that I just don't understand. Do you think you could explain it to me?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Leave it to me.\nChoice 2: I'm not sure I can.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: Great! Thank you so much! It's about this diagram here...\nChoice 2 response: Oh. Well, maybe we can figure it out together. It's about this diagram here...\nAnnette: I don't get why the knights are grouping up in that forest there. I just can't see the advantage to a formation like that.\n(screen fades to black, then back in)\n\nAnnette: Yay! I finally get it! You really are a great teacher.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm always happy to help.\nChoice 2: You're the one who did the work.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: I knew asking you was the right idea.\nChoice 2 response: No way. I couldn't have done it without you.\nAnnette: I just love learning new things. That's why I came to the Officers Academy. I want to learn magic, battle tactics, martial arts, and, and... Well, all kinds of stuff! I'm learning more now than I have in my whole entire life! Speaking of, I'd better go visit the library for some research before magic practice, which is just before sword training...\nByleth: Don't overdo it.\nAnnette: That's just not possible! I always find it's more tiring to laze around doing nothing. I've never been any good at that. I have to have something to do. Like, on my days off, I need to get up early and take care of the cleaning first, or I just...can't relax. Know what I mean?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Not really.\nChoice 2: I know the feeling.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: But a day without accomplishments is completely wasted!\nChoice 2 response: Oh, I'm so glad you agree! You'd be surprised how rare it is to find people like us. Mercie never sets foot outside her room on her days off. I don't get that girl sometimes.\nAnnette: Not to mention... Oh wait... Oh no! I was supposed to be on cooking duty today! I completely forgot! Sorry, Professor, but I have to run! Thanks again for your help!\n(Annette leaves)\n\nByleth: …\nAnnette: (Off-screen) Argh! Who put this stupid barrel here?\nByleth: …_Annette: I'm so sorry, Professor... I somehow overslept and missed our training session. I didn't mean to cause you and the other so much trouble.\n(Academy Phase): Imagine if that had happened during one of our missions. It really is inexcusable!\n(War Phase): Imagine if that had happened when i was needed in battle! It really is inexcusable!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Don't worry about it.\nChoice 2: You need to rest more.\nAnnette: It's just...when I'm studying tactics, I lose track of time, and... Oh, who am I kidding? I've always been like this.\nAnnette: Before I came to the Officers Academy, I was a student at the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad. Even back then, I was pulling all-nighters well before the exams. And I never even noticed I was harming myself. I'm just too focused on my goal. I know I've already told you this, but I really love to learn new things. It's a passion of sorts. I first realized I had the learning bug when I was about four or five years old. My father was so happy to see me using magic... Seeing him happy made me happy too, and that made me want to work even harder. If only things could have stayed like that...\nByleth: What do you mean?\nAnnette: When I was about 13, my father left home. He was a devout man, so I figured he'd gone to the monastery. That's why I went to the school of sorcery, so that I could eventually get accepted at the Officers Academy. I studied harder than ever, and sure enough, I finally earned a referral. Unfortunately, my passion for learning became more of an obsession. I got so focused, I kind of forgot how to relax. It feels like I've been running in circles ever since.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Rest is just as important as work.\nChoice 2: You're impressive just as you are.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: That's true. Just look at today. If my hard work stops me from working hard, what good is it?\nChoice 2 response: No way! I still have such a long way to go. Still, I guess I'm doing something wrong if I'm working so hard I can't even work hard anymore.\nAnnette: OK, it's decided. From now on, I'll try my best not to try my best!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You have my support.\nChoice 2: That's confusing.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: Yay! With you on my side, I'm sure to succeed!\nChoice 2 response: I'm sorry! All I meant is that I'll try... I mean, I'll slow down a bit.\nAnnette: From now on, if you see me going overboard, just let me know. I'm a new woman, after all!_Annette: …\nAnnette: Oh. Hi, Professor.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You look down.\nChoice 2: Did something happen?\nAnnette: Do you remember what we talked about before? About doing my best to not do my best? Well, I've been pretty busy recently, and despite my best efforts, I've been trying way to hard... I was busy all day yesterday with training and work. I just couldn't help myself! That's why I decided to take a day off today. It's just... Now that I have a day off, I don't know what to do with myself! Please, you have to help me! What should I do?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Nothing.\nChoice 2: Have a nap.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: I can't relax if I'm doing nothing! I need something to keep me occupied or I'll go nuts!\nChoice 2 response: I tried that! I couldn't calm down enough to fall asleep. I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm cut out for not doing my best... Oh! You're a professor! You must know some secret technique for deep relaxation, right? If you do, please teach me! I'm begging you! I'm at my wit's end!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Have a cup of tea.\nChoice 2: Have some sweets.\nAnnette: Got it! I'll try that right now! Mmm! This candy is so sweet and delicious! And it goes so well with piping hot tea! Ooh, and speaking of the tea, your brewing skills are incredible! I'd love to be able to make such nice tea, but... Oh, Professor! Will you teach me how to brew tea like this? I'll do my best to learn, and then I'll make delicious tea for you as thanks!\nByleth: Is this doing your best...\nAnnette: Oh... Um, sorry. Back to my old tricks, it seems... Oh! Why is it so difficult to not do my best?! I try and try not to try, but it just doesn't work!\nByleth: Just be yourself.\nAnnette: Professor... You're right! Doing nothing is just not my style! To be myself, I've got to do my best every day!\nByleth: That's the spirit!\nAnnette: OK! Then you really must teach me how to make such delicious tea! You will, won't you? Please! Oh, and also... Well, thank you. You've listened to me and helped me face my troubles. Now I feel like I can talk to you about anything. Honestly, I wish we could go on drinking tea like this forever..._null_null_Annette: There you are! Everybody's been looking for you. It must be hard being so popular. I bet it's a whole lot of work too... If I'm being honest, I'm a little bit envious.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's hard work.\nChoice 2: I like to keep busy.\nAnnette:\nChoice 1 response: Oh, but don't you enjoy keeping busy?\nChoice 2 response: So do I! Like I said, I'm envious.\nAnnette: After each battle, there's always more to do, so every day is exciting in its own way. Though it's true I haven't been able to relax for a while...no matter where I go or what I do. OK, so I finally realized why it is I feel this way. It's because...I need you.\nByleth: What do you mean?\nAnnette: When I'm with you, I feel like I can be myself. It's not a matter of doing my best or not doing my best... What really affects my happiness is whether I'm with you or not. Hehe! Um, actually, I've practiced what I'm going to say to you countless times... But of course, now that it's time to say it, I'm feeling shy. Terribly shy...\nByleth: I feel the same way.\nAnnette: You... You what?! Oh goodness! You really mean it!\n(Byleth presents Jeralt’s ring)\n\nByleth: I love you, Annette. Marry me.\nAnnette: Oh! I...\nByleth: Yes?\nAnnette: I'm sorry! Why am I crying when I'm so happy? I've been so worried about this! I was thinking of what I'd do if...if...if you said no! But then...you asked me! I didn't even have to ask you! I'm just so relieved!\n(S Support Artwork)\n\nAnnette: I love you! So very, very much! We'll be together forever! And ever! I promise to make you happier than anyone's ever been, my darling!

3_13_Annette: Good morning, Your Highness! Getting in some early training, huh?\nDimitri: Oh, it's not too terribly early. And what about you?\nAnnette: Oh, I'm just going for my morning walk. Hey, maybe you'd like to join me. It's a great way to start the day!\nDimitri: A morning walk? Funny. Gustave always kept the same habit. You really do remind me of your father, Annette.\nAnnette: I hear that a lot. Father was always busy with work, so he wasn't around much. But when he was home, he'd often take me with him for his walks.\nDimitri: Annette... Something's been weighing on me. Something I've done terribly wrong. Your father... He worked tirelessly. I don't know if I ever saw him take a rest. I feel as though, in a way, we stole him from you.\nAnnette: I'll admit, it was a bit lonely growing up...but I understand. Father loved his work. No one ever doubted that. Actually...I've been thinking recently that I'd like to talk to you more, Your Highness.\nDimitri: Oh? Any reason in particular?\nAnnette: Father was a man of few words, both with myself and my mother. But sometimes he would tell me about you. So...you don't really feel like a stranger to me. In a way, it's like I've known you for a long time... Almost as though you're my big brother.\nDimitri: Your...big brother?\nAnnette: Oh! Uh... I'm so sorry. I don't know why I let that slip out. That was rude of me.\nDimitri: No, nonsense! I promise you, I don't mind at all. It's certain that my days would have been filled with more fun if I'd had a little sister like you. What kind of things did Gustave tell you about me? I'd love to hear more on this topic.\nAnnette: Do you really want to know? Well, for one, he used to tell this story about when you were a child and...\nDimitri: You know what? Never mind. I have a bad feeling about where this is going. How about you forget we had this talk altogether? And don't mention it to anyone..._Annette: Your Highness! I have a little favor to ask of you.\nDimitri: Of course. How may I be of assistance?\nAnnette: Well, I was hoping you could...tell me about my father. I imagine he was a very different man at home than he was at work.\nDimitri: Ah, so you wish to hear about the Gustave that I knew... As you know, he was a knight who served the royal family since my grandfather's reign. To me, he was a teacher of martial arts and tactics. He was someone I depended on since I was a small child. But he was also a very stern and strict instructor.\nAnnette: That doesn't surprise me. He was much the same at home. He'd chide us if we made mistakes, whether it was with cooking or even how we spoke.\nDimitri: Is that so? Funny. I suppose in front of his family he felt the need to demonstrate proper etiquette.\nAnnette: Wait... Are you saying that's not how he was around you?\nDimitri: Even all these years alter, there's something I recall with perfect clarity. It happened in the autumn of my eleventh year... Before the break of dawn, he woke me suddenly. Said he'd heard a disturbance and had me grab my bow... Then he set me and a fellow pupil loose on a dark mountain. Our only directive was to \"go catch a deer.\" As you well know, autumn in the capital is very cold. Now imagine being up on the mountain at night, with no idea what might jump out from the shadows. That, in a nutshell, is the Gustave I know.\nAnnette: Hehe, I can hardly imagine that! He was completely different with me.\nDimitri: I recall one other defining detail... He used to speak of you at every possible opportunity.\nAnnette: Really? What would he say about me?\nDimitri: Are you sure you want to know? There's one story he used to tell, from when you were very small...\nAnnette: No, stop! It's probably too embarrassing to bear... Is it?\nDimitri: Ah, perhaps...\nAnnette: Look, I'll promise to forget the stories he told me about you, if you return the favor. Deal?\nDimitri: Yes, that seems the only thing to do. It's a promise._Annette: Your Highness! I have one more favor to ask...\nDimitri: Is this about Gustave again? I have plenty more stories about him, but perhaps it is time for you to speak with him yourself...\nAnnette: Um, it's not about Father this time. This time, I wanted to ask about you.\nDimitri: About me?\nAnnette: I mean, I heard all about Father last time. But I didn't ask about you.\nDimitri: Ah, well... I am afraid there is not much of interest for me to tell you.\nAnnette: Oh, it doesn't have to be funny or interesting! That's not why I'm asking. It's just that I thought I already knew you, but I'm not sure I really do... That day when we were reunited at the monastery... I didn't know what to say to you. So I wanted to prepare some of your favorite food. I thought maybe if you ate something that you liked, you'd cheer up a little. But when I got to he kitchen, I realized I didn't even know what you like to eat.\nDimitri: I see... Well, it's a little hard to say what my favorite is. I just don't really have any strong feelings about food. That said... You're pretty keen on sweet things, right, Annette?\nAnnette: Yes, that's right. I'm at my happiest when I'm digging into a sweet treat. Oh! Did you know there's a famous sweets shop in the capital?\nDimitri: Yes... It often had long lines outside, didn't it? The castle guards often spoke of it.\nAnnette: The sweets were so good... They cost a fortune, but I loved them. When Father was still around, we all lived as a family in the capital. Since then, I've had them only a few times. Ahh... How I'd love to taste them again.\nDimitri: Say, Annette... When this war is over, where will you go? I heard that you were close to Baron Dominic back in the academy days.\nAnnette: That's right... But five years ago, my uncle betrayed the Kingdom and went over to the Empire's side. I reconnected with Father. So I'd like to live with my family again, in the capital. Also, if I'm in the capital, I'll be able to see you from time to time... Right?\nDimitri: Ah, that settles it, then! We'll have to get your father working twice as hard!\nAnnette: Father's at a ripe old age now. I'd appreciate it if you didn't work him too hard!\nDimitri: Oh, of course. I will keep that in mind._Annette: Your Highness! Thank you for everything.\nDimitri: This is sudden... Why so formal? You are not about to tell me you intend to leave the army, are you?\nAnnette: Oh, no, it's no that. I just had the chance to return to the capital on military business. It had really been a long time. Life's pretty hard there right now, but its old vitality seems to be returning, bit by bit. If it wasn't for you, I'm sure things wouldn't be looking so promising. So...\nDimitri: Come now, no need to exaggerate. Do not forget that I abandoned them and fled once as well.\nAnnette: You had no choice! If you had remained in the capital, you would have been killed. If you keep thinking so dark and gloomy, you're going to end up looking just like Father.\nDimitri: Annette... You probably do no realize, but over those five years, I took many, many lives. I slaughtered generals and officials alike, with brutality you would scarcely think a human was capable of. And as I have intensified my fight with the Empire, how many people have fallen in the capital? My hands are already dripping with blood. I cannot be forgiven.\nAnnette: You really are a lot more like Father than I am. Before Father left us, he used to say similar things. I don't want you to end up like him, so I've been thinking... When this war is over, I was wondering whether I could help you with your work. Of course, I don't know how much I'd be able to support a king...\nDimitri: What are you saying?\nAnnette: If I leave you to your own devices, you'll forget how to laugh! We can't have that. You won't be able to do what you have to do with such a miserable look n your face. So, if you'll have me, I'd like to stay by your side. If you're sad or suffering, I'll just starve you until you muster a smile!\nDimitri: Starve me... Hahaha!\nAnnette: Hey! You weren't supposed to laugh at that part! I thought a lot about this!\nDimitri: Heh... Sorry... I could not help myself. Certainly, with you around, I will not have any cause to frown. By all means, join me, Annette. And never lose that sweet smile of yours.\nAnnette: Yes! I promise!_A+_null_

In fact... I just might.\nAnnette: Claude! Ugh. Can you please...forget that you saw that? I was just making up a silly song to pass the time while watering the plants.\nClaude: Sure, sure, it can be my secret serenade, if you so please. But tell me... You were born in Faerghus, right?\nAnnette: Yes, that's right.\nClaude: I thought so. You're really talented, you know. It's been a while since I heard a song like that. One that stirs me to my very soul.\nAnnette: Soul stirring? My creepity creep song? I think that's a bit of an exaggeration...\nClaude: I never, ever exaggerate. In fact, it reminded me of rituals we have back where I grew up. We'd gather around a blazing fire and spend the whole night caught up in song and dance. Not unlike what you just demonstrated. Really, the dance I'm thinking of is exactly like the one you just did. We'd scream like beasts and then jump up and roll around. It's freeing, isn't it?\nAnnette: Scream? Like a beast? That's not what I was doing. And...and what's this weird ritual you're talking about?\nClaude: Even better than your angelic voice were your lyrics. I can't even begin to fathom the deep meaning they contain, but maybe if we talk about it...\nAnnette: Deep meaning? No... Just... No.\nClaude: Oh, I get it. It's the sort of thing you have to figure out for yourself. OK, don't tell me. Give me time. I'll work it out.\nAnnette: Work what out?\nClaude: Oh... Have you already watered the plants? Sorry, I'm just realizing it was supposed to be my turn this week.\nAnnette: Ah, no, it's fine. Really.\nClaude: OK, see you later then. ♪ Creepity creeep… ♪\nAnnette: He is not gonna let this go, is he..._Claude: Hi Annette. Looks like some tasty food you've got there. Mind if I join you?\nAnnette: Sure, but I'm finished eating. You're here late. Busy day?\nClaude: Very. I got caught up thinking about your song. I find it really makes the time fly.\nAnnette: So you didn't manage to forget about that. I really wish you would.\nClaude: Alas, I cannot! That song is engraved on my soul. The lyrics...they echo in my brain, begging to be understood. Those words represent the cry of a poor soul who died in anguish... Is that it? That's it, isn't it?\nAnnette: The cry...of a poor soul?\nClaude: A land that's dark and frigidly cold... That could only mean the underworld. In my search for truth, I read up on the old rituals of the eastern regions of Faerghus. Those who died with regret are thought to end up in an underworld of sorts. Somewhere cold. Somewhere dark. Somewhere...creepy. To escape from their bitter limbo, they did their way up through the earth, trying to find the surface...or the light in other words. And so they creep about endlessly in the cold dirt of the underworld, clinging to their hopeless desire...Creepity creep, Annette. Creepity creep.\nAnnette: Eh...\nClaude: So? Was I right or was I right?\nAnnette: What? No! You're not even close! It wasn't supposed to be a dark and miserable song at all.\nClaude: Huh. Now that I think about it...the melody and dance didn't really match the weight of the lyrics.\nAnnette: The lyrics are simply about seeds pushing out of the ground to become sweet, little buds. They creep through the dirt until they find the light! The song just describes what it's like to be a budding flower.\nClaude: Damn. That is good stuff. OK, maybe I read too much into it. Actually, now that you've explained, it really is a nice little song. Creepity creep... The gentle journey from the ground to the surface. I love it.\nAnnette: Do you...think it's embarrassing that I made up such a silly song?\nClaude: Not at all. Oh! But that reminds me. I was so inspired by Creepity Creep that I made up some lyrics of my own. I've been nonchalantly carrying them around with me hoping to run into you.

It's a song about your single-minded march through life.\nAnnette: It's about...me?!\nClaude: Of course! You know, about how you mess up and make a big fuss about stuff sometimes, but you're always looking ahead and striving. I just wanted to capture your pleasant, fidgety, fussy nature in a song.\nAnnette: Haha, I see! I'm flattered...I think? Actually, I can't really tell if you're saying something nice or not...\nClaude: Of course I'm saying something nice! I'm so happy I get to be friends with someone like you. Everyone's really uplifted by your cheerful attitude, your refusal to give up, and that boisterous nature of yours.\nAnnette: Boisterous... That's definitely not a compliment. Still... Thank you, Claude. I'm really pleased that you thought so hard about me and wrote a neat song like that. You know, what this song really needs is a nice little dance to go with it...\nClaude: I couldn't agree more! And once you've finished, you should perform it for everyone. You're a fine dancer, after all!\nAnnette: Nope! Not happening! I'm afraid my dances are not for public consumption. It will have to suffice that I let you see it.\nClaude: You drive a hard bargain. And if this performance is just for me, maybe I can coax you into letting me hear some of your other songs?\nAnnette: I suppose there are a few others I could maybe share. Like my bear song! Or my dungeon song! Ooh! Or the waltz of the swamp beasties!\nClaude: I have never been more on board with anything in my entire life!\nAnnette: Oh, they're all just silly songs... I don't know that they're anything worth being excited about.\nClaude: I'll be the judge of that, and I can tell just by their descriptions that I'm right to be excited.\nAnnette: Well! I guess I have no choice. I'm making an exception just for you, Claude.\nClaude: I'm honored to be the exception, as well as your number one fan!_null_null_null_
3_28_Annette: Phew... I guess taking them all up in one go was a bad idea...\nLinhardt: Annette? Are you OK with all those boxes?\nAnnette: Linhardt! Hi! I'm so glad you're here!\nAnnette: I don't know if I'll be able to handle all these...\nAnnette: I thought I may as well get it over with, so I decided to carry them all at once. Big mistake.\nLinhardt: Smart thinking. \"Do it all at once!\" That's what they say, right? Work smart, not hard.\nLinhardt: I think you've got it from here, so I'm off to take a nap. Good luck.\n(Linhardt walks off screen)\n\nAnnette: But maybe you could help! Nope. Gone. Gah. It is fine. Just a little further to my quarters. I've got this. I'll just... Just... Gaah! Huh? They didn't fall...\nLinhardt: That was almost pretty bad.\nAnnette: Linhardt! I thought you had an important nap to get to.\nLinhardt: I'd call it insomnia, but I suppose it was really just a guilty conscience. I came to see if you needed help. And sure enough, here you are, about to tip all the boxes on the floor.\nAnnette: Thanks. Though it may have been best if you had just chipped in from the start...\nLinhardt: Huh? But it was your job. Why would I step in? You clearly had things handled.\nAnnette: Then why help me at all?\nLinhardt: If the boxes had fallen just now, everyone would have had to help tidy them up anyway. If anything broke, more boxes would need to be carried... And if all of that came to pass, then there'd be noise and more noise and no chance of my taking a nap.\nAnnette: Huh. But if you had helped me from the start, there would have been no danger of anything being dropped at all.\nLinhardt: Correct. But there was no danger yet, and so there was no need for my help. So I left you to it. Try carrying one box at a time instead of straining to do it all at once. Work smart, not hard, as they say. All right, well, I think you've got it from here, so I'm off. Good luck.\n(Linhardt walks off screen)\n\nAnnette: After all that, he's still not going to help me._Annette: Linhardt, wake up!\n(Part 1) The lecture's over.\n(Part 2) The war meeting's over.\nLinhardt: Mm? Mmm, huh? What, is it morning already?\nAnnette: Morning is long gone.\n(Part 1) I said the lecture's finished.\n(Part 2) I said the war meeting's finished.\nLinhardt: If that's the case, I suppose I can sleep a little longer...\nAnnette: No. You. Can. Not. Get up this instant!\nLinhardt: Calm down... Calm down. I was having a wonderful dream...\nAnnette: Oh? What were you dreaming about?\nLinhardt: I was dreaming about the best afternoon nap of my life, and the dream I was having in the dream was amazing...\nAnnette: I thought as much. I have to ask. I'm pretty sure you could do anything you put your mind to, so why do you spend so much of your life sleeping?\nLinhardt: I sleep because I'm tired. What other reason would I have?\nAnnette: No one can be that tired all the time.\nLinhardt: Well, not all the time, no. Most nights, I'm quite wide awake. Sometimes I get distracted and forget to sleep. Usually, I sleep for two days for every three I'm awake.\nAnnette: Are you kidding me? No one sleeps for two days. That's beyond lazy. That's... There's not even a word for that!\nLinhardt: I can't help it that my sleep schedule fails to line up with everyone else's.\nAnnette: After I did you the favor of waking you up, you could at least take this seriously. Look, putting in effort is how you grow. You know, as a person and stuff.\n(Part 1) If you keep this up, you're going to end up just another hopeless dropout.\n(Part 2) Everyone else is working really hard to end the war. Are you really OK with coasting like this?\nLinhardt: I'll be fine, Annette. I'll be just...fine... Anyway, I'm pretty beat. Talk again soon.\n(Linhardt walks off screen)\n\nAnnette: Linhardt! I wasn't finished talking!_Annette: Ahh, there's nothing like a morning stroll to take in some fresh air! Hm? In the thicket there. Is that...a human foot? Eeek! It moved! Someone, help!\n(Linhardt gets up from the ground)\n\nLinhardt: Sorry, Annette...I was really out.\nAnnette: Hey! You shouldn't surprise people like that! I thought you were an undead corpse... Why are you sleeping out here anyway? We're in the middle of a war! Doesn't that seem dangerous?\nLinhardt: Middle of a war or no, you'll not defeat the master of dreams. He's a fiercely strong enemy.\nAnnette: Stop joking around! What are you even talking about?\nLinhardt: No joking, I assure you. He is quite unstoppable. Or perhaps you know his weakness?\nAnnette: You really never change, do you? You sleep as much as ever... Do you even remember what I told you?\nLinhardt: You told me something? When?\nAnnette: Of course you don't. I told you that putting in effort...\nLinhardt: \"is how you grow.\" Is that the one?\nAnnette: So...you do remember?\nLinhardt: Should I not have remembered?\nAnnette: No! Ugh. It's just...you should put your talents to use elsewhere, that's all.\nLinhardt:\n(If Linhardt and Hubert's B support is achieved) Hmm... Have you been speaking to Hubert?\nLinhardt: The truth is I place effort in what brings me joy. I'm happiest that way.\nAnnette: No, that's not... OK, let me put it this way instead. Working hard for other people helps you grow as a person. Do you not get the urge to work hard for other people, like when you helped me before?\nLinhardt: Not as such. Why would I go through that effort? For what gain?\nAnnette: Um, for the gain I mentioned...that it helps you grow as a person.\nLinhardt: Oh, I see. Well then, continue working hard for my sake. For example, waking me up today. And I suppose I will try to do a little bit more for you too... I find working for others to be annoying, yet I wish to make an exception for you. I hope that's all right...\nAnnette: Just for me?\nLinhardt: Indeed. You're the only person I'd bother helping. I could wear myself out helping you. Forever, maybe. What about it? I'll be there for you, and you can be there for me.\nAnnette: Oh! What do you mean by that?!\nLinhardt: What?\nAnnette: If we're doing our best for each other and all, then that's a bit like...just kind of like...like a marriage!\nLinhardt: Huh. You know, I feel as if you might be able to wake me up every morning. No small feat, that.\nAnnette: Hmph! As though I would marry a man who can't even get up in the morning!_null_null_null_
3_7_Annette: That was my worst mistake yet. Why am I so clumsy all the time?! The women laughed and forgave me, but... How am I supposed to face them now?\nCaspar: Hey there, Annette! What's with the sour face? Everything OK? I don't think I've ever seen you look so miserable!\nAnnette: Don't tease me like that, Caspar! Can't you see I'm down?\nCaspar: Sorry, sorry. You know I didn't mean it. Did something happen? You don't have to share if you don't want to, but I think talking it out might help.\nAnnette: You might be right about that... Are you sure you don't mind?\nCaspar: Not at all.\nAnnette: Well... Today they were short on staff in the dining hall, so I offered to help out... But I sort of...messed up—big.\nCaspar: Oh no. What happened?\nAnnette: All the plates in the kitchen went flying through the air. And the pots started giving off this weird blue steam.\nCaspar: Wow, sounds more like art than cooking to me.\nAnnette: The people in the dinging hall saw the chaos and started panicking, and then soldiers came running... Finally, Catherine appeared and shut everyone up with a slash of Thunderbrand. All I was trying to do was help out. But in the end, I just ended up making more work for everyone. I'm awful like that.\nCaspar: I wouldn't worry about it too much. Accidents happen. It's not like you were trying to make a mess.\nAnnette: I know. The women at the dining hall laughed and forgave me. But...\nCaspar: Was anyone hurt?\nAnnette: Well, no. But...\nCaspar: Well, there you go! No need to dwell on it and keep moping around. You had a bad day, but I'm sure you'll do better tomorrow.\nAnnette: You know what? You're right! I guess all I can do is try harder next time. Thanks, Caspar. That really did help me feel better. I can't keep moping around! I've got to work on my cooking skills! And I can count on you to be my taste tester, right? Right!\nCaspar: Uhh...sure. Just as long as you're not making any new art projects..._Annette: Why did this have to happen... Getting separated from my own troop... I'm a failure as a commander... It's already almost sunset... My wounds are aching... And I'm so hungry... Maybe I'm just going to die right here... Oh, but no! That's such a pathetic way to die... I wonder if the rest of my soldiers are OK... I'm so worried about them...\n(screen fades to black, then back in)\n\nCaspar: Up and at 'em, Annette! There you go!\nAnnette: Caspar? What are you doing here? I was wounded in the forest... lost sight of my troop... I wandered around and... oh! Where is everyone?!\nCaspar: Calm down, you got nothing to worry about. They're fine! My men retrieved the rest of your unit. You're the one we've been worried about. How ya feeling? Are you hurt? You've got a pretty painful looking wound on your leg.\nAnnette: Oh, I'm all right... Though I might have trouble running...\nCaspar: If you say so... I gotta admit, I got the chills when I heard you were missing. Your soldiers told me what happened. I was only able to find you thanks to them. You've got a good troop there! You should be proud!\nAnnette: …\nCaspar: What's wrong, Annette? Not feeling so good after all?\nAnnette: No, that's not it. I was just thinking about what a hopeless commander I am... It's my job to look after my soldiers, but they ended up having to look out for me... If I'm this hopeless, I shouldn't be out there at all...\nCaspar: What are you talking about? I don't know anyone around here who works harder than you. You put your all into your work and everyone knows it. Why do you think your soldiers are so loyal?\nAnnette: Caspar..\nCaspar: There's no way they'd do so much for you if they didn't see it in you. C'mon, let's head back. I'll help you if you're having trouble walking. Your soldiers are worried about you. Go show 'em you're doing just fine!\nAnnette: Yes... You're right! Thank you, Caspar.\nCaspar: No problem! Just remember that it's OK to make mistakes, as long as you're learning from them!_Annette: Hey, Caspar. Can I ask you something?\nCaspar: Well, hey there, Annette! What's on your mind?\nAnnette: Is there anything you pay particular attention to on the battlefield? Stuff you make sure not to mess up? I don't want to make any major mistakes again... So I've been thinking about how I can improve. But it's trickier than I thought! I was hoping you could give me some direction.\nCaspar: Nothing I can think of! Sometimes you just gotta mess up!\nAnnette: Huh? Really? Nothing at all?\nCaspar: Nah. No matter how much you prepare, you're always gonna make mistakes. All you can do is quit worrying and try your best!\nAnnette: Hm. I guess that does sound like something you'd say. But I'm not sure how much use it is to me.\nCaspar: That's too bad. It's a great way to live. You worry about messing up, and all that worry makes you nervous, right? So being nervous on the battlefield is the reason you make mistakes you'd never make in training!\nAnnette: Well, yes. People's lives are on the line! If I mess up, they might actually die! When I think that my failures might put everyone in danger, I...\nCaspar: Ugh! You gotta quit doubting yourself! It's not helping! You're obsessing about failures that haven't even happened! What's the point in that? Sometimes you're gonna mess up no matter how hard you train. That's life!\nAnnette: So what you're saying is, I should stop being afraid of failure, and just try my hardest on the battlefield, like I do in training...\nCaspar: Was I not clear on that? You just gotta deal with your mistakes when you make 'em!\nAnnette: That really is just like you, Caspar. I'm starting to feel stupid for worrying so much. You're so strong and confident. I really like that about you!\nCaspar: Haha, aww. Thanks, Annette! I think you're great too!\nAnnette: OK, I'm going to try following your example from now on! It's time I stopped moping around here and put everything I've got into training! Right, Caspar?!\nCaspar: That's the spirit! Let's get out there and train! I'll race you to the stables!\nAnnette: Yeah!_null_null_null_
3_12_Annette: (off screen) Agh! No!\nAnnette: Oh no-oh no-oh no! Please tell me that wasn't the pan...\nDedue: What was that noise?\nAnnette: Dedue! Well, as you can see...the pan kind of...exploded. Just a little.\nDedue: How did you manage that?\nAnnette: I looked away for a moment and the pan just went BOOM! Ugh, I'm grateful nothing caught fire, but now the kitchen is a mess.\nDedue: Are you hurt?\nAnnette: Oh, no. I just got a little spooked. Heh, I really lucked out, didn't I? That could have turned out much worse.\nDedue: Indeed. But do not turn your back next time. Your life could depend on it.\nAnnette: Right. Sorry. I'll be more careful from now on.\nDedue: Let me help you.\nAnnette: Huh?\nDedue: I will help you clean up.\nAnnette: No! I can't let you do that! This is all my fault. You shouldn't have to help me.\nDedue: I have time. Let's fix this quickly. We will need to prepare more food before the others arrive at the dining hall.\nAnnette: Oh, you're right. So, after we clean up, you're also gonna...help me cook?\nDedue: You object?\nAnnette: Of course not! I'm just so sorry to bother you with this.\nDedue: …_Annette: Hi, Dedue! I wanted to thank you again for helping me out the other day. Everything was ready in time for dinner, and we all agreed the food was really tasty!\nDedue: I barely did anything.\nAnnette: That's silly talk! With just a few ingredients, you made an amazing meal! I could never have done it, no way. You deserve all the praise in the world!\nDedue: I still have much to learn. Truly delicious food brings a smile to people's faces. Until I see His Highness smile that way, I will spare no effort to improve.\nAnnette: Well, if that's your aim, you're in luck! I've seen him shovel in your food with gusto. You must be really ambitious if you're not satisfied with that meal. I've love for you to teach me your ways. I want to be a great cook too!\nDedue: Your skills are not the problem. You merely make errors of negligence.\nAnnette: Well, sure...I know that. But how can I stop making those errors? No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess things up. The pan explodes when I cook. I forget my purse when I go shopping. That's just how life is for a scatterbrain like me. Just the other day I was nearly laughed off the training ground for wearing mismatched shoes! My uncle used to sigh in despair when he saw me messing something up.\nDedue: You simply fail to pay attention to your surroundings. Ensure the pan is on the flame, and that the knives are put away properly. Look at yourself in the mirror before you go out to make certain you have what you need. Everyone makes mistakes, but yours should be easy enough to correct.\nAnnette: That's all great advice. Thank you, Dedue! You really have a kind heart. At first I thought you were so stern all the time.\nDedue: Am I that imposing?\nAnnette: Uh. Well. A bit? Maybe if you smiled sometimes. All you have to do is lift up the corners of your mouth, like this. See?\nDedue: I see. I— will try it.\nAnnette: No! I can't let you do that! This is all my fault. You shouldn't have to help me._Annette: Agh! I'm sorry! So sorry!\nDedue: What is it, Annette?\nAnnette: I completely forgot that it's my turn for kitchen duty today! Huh? Dedue... Did you do all the kitchen prep already?\nDedue: Kitchen duty is mine today.\nAnnette: What? But... Did I get the day wrong?\nDedue: Yes. Yours is tomorrow.\nAnnette: Oh! Haha, I'm so sorry! Wow, I really am something else...\nDedue: These things happen.\nAnnette: Hahaha!\nDedue: Is something funny?\nAnnette: Oh, no. I was just happy. You see... My uncle is really strict. He wanted me to be perfect at cooking, studying, cooking, washing...everything, really. He said if I wasn't perfect, as a knight's daughter, I'd be devaluing my Crest. Whenever I messed up he'd look so mad... And he'd sigh, like he'd just lost his faith in humanity.\nDedue: That is harsh.\nAnnette: Oh, I know he loved me and all... He was just kind of scary. But you've helped me out and been patient with me without getting mad. I'm just so happy! Thank you, Dedue.\nDedue: I have hardly done anything.\nAnnette: You know what? You remind me of my father. You look scary at first glance, but you're actually really kind!\nDedue: Is that so...\nAnnette: Oh, right! Let me help you with something, if that's OK with you! What are you cooking today? Hopefully, I can chip in...\nDedue: It is a meat dish from Faerghus.\nAnnette: Uh... I'm still a complete klutz, so I'm not going to be in the way, am I?\nDedue: Not at all. I was hoping that the food I made would bring a smile to your face.\nAnnette: Oh, wow. That's...\nDedue: …\nAnnette: Haha, well then! I can't wait for dinnertime!\nDedue: Good._Dedue: Forgive me.\nAnnette: Hehe, it's fine! Honestly, it's pretty funny when you think about it.\nDedue: I did not expect the horse to react so violently when I approached.\nAnnette: No kidding! And I didn't expect the two of us to get covered in hay!\nDedue: Animals have never taken to me. It must be as you said— my face is the problem. I have not honed my smile well enough. I deeply regret the trouble I've caused you.\nAnnette: Don't be ridiculous! And especially don't be sad. It's no trouble at all, I promise. Everyone makes mistakes. Isn't that what you've been trying to teach me?\nDedue: Yes, I suppose so.\nAnnette: It does look like this will take a while to clean up. But if we work together, it'll be done in no time!\nDedue: I am truly sorry.\nAnnette: Don't apologize. When it's your turn for stable duty, I'm happy to help.\nDedue: Really?\nAnnette: Sure! And in return, you can help me out when I'm on kitchen duty.\nDedue: Of course.\nAnnette: By the way, I tried out all that stuff you mentioned before. About how not to be a scatterbrain. I'm still pretty hopeless, but thanks to you, I'm making fewer mistakes. It's probably not a good idea for me to be left alone around knives and boiling water though. That's why it'll be nice knowing you have my back!\nDedue: You have changed.\nAnnette: Huh?\nDedue: You no longer fear asking me for help. You simply ask. And now, when the need arises, I will rely on you too._B+_null_

3_4_Annette: Oh! Ashe. Are you here to study too?\nAshe: I am! It's quiet i here. Easier to concentrate.\nAnnette: It really is. Hey, would you like to study together? We can help each other out if we get stuck.\nAshe: Oh, yes! We'll get a lot more done working together.\n(They start studying together.)\n\nAshe: Uh... Hmm...\nAnnette: What's the matter, Ashe?\nAshe: This question's got me stumped. \"A ballista inside a castle is ready to fire at enemies outside. What angle should be used for the shot? Assume the ballista is the same as those in Garreg Mach. Ignore the effects of wind.\" This is fore defensive strategy, isn't it? Why is it so complicated? Don't you just aim and fire?\nAnnette: Hmm... It may help to focus on maximizing target accuracy to reduce your miss rate. To start, let's sort out the setup. Let's see...using the ballista specifications... If the ballista quarrels follow this trajectory, they'll hit the enemy lines, right?\nAshe: Oh, that makes sense! Because the enemy line will be here!\nAnnette: That's it! OK, now try using that same technique and applying it to this other problem.\nAshe: If the walls are this high, and he enemy lines are that distance—ah! I think I see!\nAnnette: I knew you'd get it.\nAshe: Wow. I didn't expect math, of all things, to be useful in a siege. This is tough. Numbers are not my strong suit. But this really is the sort of thing you have to know if you want to command troops.\nAnnette: That's true. But not everyone is good with numbers. That's why we have tacticians to do these calculations for us, or prepare them before we go to battle. A century ago, the Empire's mathematicians played a huge role in the Battle of the Wall of Fódlan.\nAshe: I had no idea. Hey, you really know what you're doing, Annette!\nAnnette: You think so?\nAshe: Definitely! You've obviously done a lot of studying. I really admire that.\nAnnette: I suppose I have! Studying is a necessity if you want the advantage over your enemies. But necessity aside, it's nice to hear you say that._Annette: OK, now that you know the technique, go ahead and solve this problem.\nAshe: Ah— I've got it! Finally!\nAnnette: See? Isn't it fun to learn?\nAshe: Absolutely! You're great at this, you know. You really seem to have all the answers. I wish I could study and just soak up knowledge like you. How did you get so good at this?\nAnnette: Well, studying was something of a necessity for me.\nAshe: What do you mean?\nAnnette: My father was one of the king's knights. One day, he never returned home. He just left without ever saying a word to me or my mother.\nAshe: I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a father so suddenly... I completely understand.\nAnnette: After he left, I thought a lot about where he might have gone. My father was a devout believer, so I was certain he must have come here to Garreg Mach.\nAshe: Here? Really?!\nAnnette: That's why I was determined to gain acceptance into the academy. I needed to come here so I could search for my father. The problem was that I needed money to get in. Lots of it. And I didn't have any at all. So I entered the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad first, hoping I could somehow find a path here. I studied tirelessly until I finally earned myself a recommendation.\nAshe: Oh, wow. So for you, studying has been like a way to meet your destiny.\nAnnette: Destiny, huh? Well, yes, but it's a bit embarrassing when you put it like that. Now I have other reasons for wanting to keep trying hard. I want to protect all of my friends and allies here. I'm studying hard so I can be as useful as possible to everyone I hold dear.\nAshe: You've worked so hard! I really respect that. I'm going to follow your example!_Annette: Aww... How unlucky that we were assigned to clean this ancient tower...\nAshe: It's not a pleasant job, but someone has to do it.\nAnnette: With all the windows boarded up, it's so dark. And there are strange noises... Like that noise! What was that? A rat?! Tell me it was a rat...\nAshe: B-better than a ghost!\nAnnette: You're not scared of ghosts, are you, Ashe? I didn't think you'd be...\nAshe: You haven't seen what I've seen!\n(a noise is heard)\n\nAshe: Ahhh!\nAnnette: Ahhh! Oh no! What was that noise?\nAshe: I-it's OK! Just the wind blowing the door shut! Oh no, the latch is rusted! Ugh... It won't budge!\nAnnette: What?! You mean we're trapped in here?\nAshe: I'm sorry! I didn't think to prop the door open!\nAnnette: Don't worry about that now! We need to think of a way out of here!\nAshe: Well, what if we were to pry the boards off the windows?\nAnnette: Yes, that! We can do it in no time.\nAshe: Oh! Ah! There's something on my face!\nAnnette: Calm down, Ashe! It's a cobweb! Just a cobweb! We've got to pull ourselves together. Now, which of the windows should we check? Ah, I can't stand it here in the pitch dark!\nAshe: Oh! I've got one here. Stand back!\n(a crash is heard, they both exit)\n\nAshe: Oh... We made it.\nAnnette: I wouldn't want to go through that again... For a moment there, I didn't think we'd make it out alive. No... Wait! I've lost it. It's gone!\nAshe: What is it?\nAnnette: The doll my father gave me... I must have dropped it.\nAshe: In the tower? Are you going back for it?\nAnnette: No! It's OK... Don't worry about it. I've been meaning to throw it out for a while now.\nAshe: Are you sure? If it was a gift from your father...\nAnnette: Yes, but it can't be helped. Let's just get back to the monastery...\nAshe: Uh, right._Ashe: Almost forgot how spooky this place is. I don't know if I can do this alone... No— I've got to. What use am I to anyone if I can't even handle an empty tower? Here goes...\n(Ashe exits the screen)\n\nAnnette: The doll from my father must be in this tower. But I'm too scared to go looking for it...\nAshe: Annette!\nAnnette: Ashe! What are you doing here?\nAshe: Phew... Here! I got this for you!\nAnnette: My doll! You went back for it? But why?\nAshe: Your father gave it to you. I know you said you'd throw it away, but you can't just toss out something so important.\nAnnette: Ashe... Thank you! I'm so happy! To be honest, I didn't have the courage to go back in there to get it myself. But thanks to you, I didn't have to. And you're afraid of ghosts, right? Were you OK in there all by yourself?\nAshe: Well, ah, not really... I tried my best not to think about it. My legs shook whenever I did.\nAnnette: Oh, poor Ashe! You're safe now, I promise.\nAshe: Knock it off, would you? I'm OK now. But I'm glad I could help you and see a smile on your face. Look at me though. Haha, a grown man, and scared of ghosts. Pathetic, right?\nAnnette: No, I don't think that at all. I think you're something special, Ashe! You were really brave. And all for me... That wasn't an easy thing to do. I'm in awe of you!\nAshe: Thanks. Maybe there is still hope for me as a knight.\nAnnette: Yes, I'll gladly attest to that! I'm sure you'll be a splendid knight! Maybe you'll even outdo my father!\nAshe: That's a frightening thought, comparing me to one of the king's best knights. But it's a happy one too. It makes me want to work that much harder!_A+_null_
3_39_Sylvain: Hey, Annette. Hitting the magic books again? Has anyone ever told you that you're pretty cute when you're studying?\nAnnette: Sorry, Sylvain, but I'm trying to think right now. Could you keep quiet for a bit?\nSylvain: How can you stay focused reading a book that thick...with such small print? Is some of that text upside down?\nAnnette: If I use the formula in this line here, the magical energy should... No, that's not right...\nSylvain: You're even cuter when you're working through a difficult problem.\nAnnette: Sylvain, I'm serious! Please be quiet.\nSylvain: Hang on. Look at the third line. You've got the formula wrong.\nAnnette: I said be... Oh. You're right. How did you know that?\nSylvain: Well, I mean, it's written right there...\nAnnette: Most people wouldn't be able to grasp this formula just by glancing at it. Have you read this book before?\nSylvain: Nope, this is the first time. OK, now that I look at it... Wow. This book makes things way more complicated than they need to be.\nAnnette: Hmm... And what's your take on this part here?\nSylvain: It's just describing another application for the same formula. Ha! This is pretty easy!\nAnnette: You know...you're actually king of amazing. I've been studying magic for a while now, but even I have trouble with this stuff. You act like all you do is mess around, but are you actually working hard in secret?\nSylvain: Nah, hanging out with girls is way more fun. I guess I just picked this stuff up somewhere. Life is short, Annette. If you waste it working hard, it'll be over before you know it. Get out in the world. Have some fun!\nAnnette: That's easy for you to say. You're strong and smart without even trying. It's not fair.\nSylvain: Uh...\nAnnette: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.\nSylvain: No, I was just thinking that you're pretty cute when you're sulking. You know that?\nAnnette: What is wrong with you?\nSylvain: Hey, uh, I just got lucky with that stuff in the book. I'd normally never be able to outsmart you. Anyway...I'm gonna get out of here and leave you to it.\nAnnette: Got lucky, huh? I'm not sure about that. Well, that does it. It might be tough, but I won't accept second place. Let's go, me! I can do this! I'm going to finish this whole book before sundown!_Annette: Sylvain! Good timing. There's something I want to say to you.\nSylvain: Uh-oh. Did I do something wrong? Did you spot me sneaking back in this morning? Or is it about that girl who got mad I kissed her sister good-night... I can explain either way.\nAnnette: No! I'm not here to get after you about those things. Surely other people have that covered. What I really want to talk about is your behavior during our training sessions. When we're sparring, you're always passing on great opportunities to get the edge on me. It's almost as though you're going out of your way to make me think you're incapable!\nSylvain: Nah, I just like giving other people the spotlight.\nAnnette: Uh-huh. It's not that you took something I said to heart? About how you don't have to work hard to be good at stuff and how that isn't fair?\nSylvain: I did take those things to heart. We're friends, right? I'd be sad if you started to hate me. There's just one thing I want you to remember. Guys like me ho hate hard work and sorta get by on our wits? It all falls apart eventually. I'm smart enough to know that. So I respect people like you. I mean it.\nAnnette: Oh. Is that...sincerity? It's kind of creeping me out. It's just so unlike you!\nSylvain: Huh?\nAnnette: When you say nice things like that, I can't take joy in beating you! I want to beat you when you're at your best! That's why it bothers me so much when you don't try your hardest against me.\nSylvain: Let me put this a different way... I've always been treated like I'm special, and I'm not. At least, I don't think I am. I'm just tired of people thinking they know what I can and can't do. When everybody expects something of you or envies you...it's kind of suffocating. I'd rather people think I'm dumb. Well, I mean, I can still be pretty dumb. Heh...\nAnnette: I have to admit, I have a hard time understanding where you're coming from. Just know that...I want you to keep being great at things without trying. If you stop being that way, I won't have any competition!\nSylvain: Heh, competition, huh? I like the sound of that. Where the heck were you when I was growing up? If I had someone like you back then, I think I may have turned out different. Better, I mean. Anyway, I'd love to chat more with you. Would you like to grab some tea with me or...\nAnnette: Sure thing! The very next moment I'm free. For now, I need to get to my magic training.\nSylvain: Oh, I see. Some other time then. I look forward to it, Annette._null_null_null_null_
3_33_Annette: That shopping trip took longer than expected, didn't it Mercie?\nMercedes: It truly did. You bought just about everything in the place.\nAnnette: Hehe, you're so good at deciding the best thing to buy. I sort of wanted it all! I mean, not that I was excessive. I think you bought just about as much as I did.\nMercedes: Oh, really? The number of bags you're carrying says otherwise.\nAnnette: What?! That's... Oh, fine. You got me. I was just having too much fun! I love shopping with you, Mercie.\nMercedes: It was fun! It's nice going into town without having to run errands for once.\nAnnette: Isn't it? And I'm pretty confident the professor will forgive us for our little detour. This actually reminds me of going to school in Fhirdiad.\nMercedes: Me too. It almost feels like that time in our lives was a story from long ago.\nAnnette: So much has changed since then. Oh, but there's at least one thing that hasn't changed.\nMercedes: Me and you, right? We're the same old friends we always were.\nAnnette: That's just what I was about to say!\nMercedes: I've known you so long I can always guess.\nAnnette: Mercie, we'll stay friends like this forever... Won't we?\nMercedes: Is something wrong? You sound worried.\nAnnette: Since our time in the capital, so much has happened. We've had to make new lives for ourselves, and we've seen at least as many hard times as good. If things keep changing like this, I wonder if we'll be able to stay the same people we are now...\nMercedes: I wonder that too. I don't think everything in the future will be perfect. But it's us, so I'm sure—\nAnnette: We'll figure it out together. Right?\nMercedes: How did you know what I was going to say?\nAnnette: Oh, Mercie. I can always guess what you're going to say.\n(monastery bells are heard)\n\nMercedes: Oh. It's getting late. We'd better hurry back before the professor gets angry.\nAnnette: You're right. Run, Mercie!\n(Annette runs off screen)\n\nMercedes: What? Wait for me, Annie! You know I'm not as fast as you!\n(Mercedes follows)\n\nAnnette: Run! Haha!_Annette: OK, Mercie. This time we're gonna be really good and get the supplies with no detours.\nMercedes: You're so good at sticking to a plan. I should leave the shopping to you. I'll stay out of your way and just browse.\nAnnette: Hey, that's not fair! I want to browse too!\n(Rogue enters)\n\nRogue: Looks like you girls are havin' a good time!\nMercedes: Uh, Annie? Is this a friend of yours?\nAnnette: I've never seen this person before. I'm sorry to be rude, but we're kind of busy.\nRogue: Wait a minute. I think you're shopping with money you stole! No need to worry your pretty little heads. I'm just gonna have to take it back for us common folk!\nAnnette: Step back, Mercie. This could get dangerous. Listen here, you! There's no way you can win against me. I don't want to fight you, but I will if I have to. So just...back away!\nRogue: You think you can talk to me that way?! I'm gonna—\nMercedes: Oh! The knights are coming!\nRogue: What?!\n(Rogue flees)\n\nMercedes: Annie, run!\n(They both run)\n\nAnnette: This is far enough. We should be safe.\nMercedes: I hope so...but what were you thinking? That sort of behavior isn't like you at all!\nAnnette: I just... I thought you were in danger, Mercie!\nMercedes: You're actually blaming me for this? It's like I don't even know you anymore!\n(Mercedes leaves)\n\nAnnette: Mercie! I was just trying to protect you..._Mercedes: Annie...do you have a moment?\nAnnette: Is this about what happened when we were shopping? If so, it's fine. Don't worry about it.\nMercedes: Not so fast! I haven't properly apologized yet! So, I'm sorry. I just... I got scared. Imagine if something had happened to you because of me...\nAnnette: Mercie...\nMercedes: You would have just run away if you were on your own, wouldn't you? Instead you acted defensively because I was there. I dragged you down...\nAnnette: Mercie, you're upsetting me! How dare you say that you drag me down! You know why I was acting so recklessly? Because I wanted to protect my best friend in the whole world!\nMercedes: Annie...\nAnnette: Do you remember when we first enrolled at the academy? It seemed like everyone was leagues ahead of us and so far out of reach. I felt completely hopeless... But because you were there, I didn't lose hope. So... Don't say stupid things about how you drag me down or how you don't deserve things!\nMercedes: Thank you for saying that... And again, I'm sorry. You're just so important to me. I know I could never find another friend like you. You've stayed by my side through thick and thin... I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if anything happened to you because of me.\nAnnette: Mercie, can we be friends again?\nMercedes: Of course, Annie. Friends forever.\nAnnette: Good! I don't know what I would have done if we hadn't found a way to make up.\nMercedes: I'm sorry. I should have said something sooner.\nAnnette: No, I'm the one who should have stopped being so stubborn and said something. You know, now that everything's as it should be, I'm suddenly starving!\nMercedes: That's just like you. Come, let's go for tea.\nAnnette: Ooh, let's! And we should have some Mercie-baked sweets on the side! I think I love you more than just about anything in the world!\nMercedes: You do? Oh, Annie, you're too sweet.\nAnnette: Not as sweet as your baking! I love your baking more than anything in the world too, other than you.\nMercedes: Well, I'm always happy to bake for you, Annie!\nAnnette: I'm so happy to have you bake—uh, back!_null_null_null_
3_25_Annette: Hello, Ingrid. Can I have just a teeny tiny moment of your time?\nIngrid: Sure, I can spare a moment or two.\nAnnette: I was wondering... Do you have any interest in fashion and makeup and stuff like that?\nIngrid: I haven't the time to bother with such frivolities. As long as basic hygiene is being met, then I'm happy.\nAnnette: Oh, but you're missing out on something so fun! I mean, it's not like you need it, of course. You've got beautiful bone structure, lovely hair, long legs... But aren't you interested in trying something new?\nIngrid: Um, well, thank you... I suppose I do find it all somewhat intriguing. But my time is precious to me, and my focus is on knighthood. Taking time to paint my face simply isn't a top priority.\nAnnette: Sure, but imagine if you could combine the two and become the most fabulous knight ever! OK, maybe I'm taking it too far. I know knights don't necessarily need a ton of make-up or things like that for the job. I'm just saying I really think you'd enjoy it if you opened your mind to it. All I'm talking about is a light touch. I can see it now... Your gorgeous face done up with a delicate application of makeup. The fabulous knight who everyone looks up to and wants to be!\nIngrid: Um...well, maybe? I guess? That does sound mostly harmless...\nAnnette: Hooray! OK, we don't have a moment to lose. Here, take this makeup kit. Play around with the colors and see what speaks to you.\nIngrid: Now wait just a—\nAnnette: I actually got that little kit as a gift the other day, and I wasn't sure what to do with it, because I already have that one. It's a limited palette, but I think it fits the look you're going for perfectly.\nIngrid: I actually never agreed to start putting that stuff on my face, Annette.\nAnnette: What? Oh... Well then I guess this whole kit will have to go to waste. I'll just throw it away like the garbage it is.\nIngrid: You're throwing it away? I can't just stand by and let something go to waste... OK. All right. Thank you. We can do this.\nAnnette: That's the spirit! Oh, and I'm happy to help you learn to apply it too. Come on, let's go to my room. I have some brush techniques to show you before you get started.\nIngrid: Now, don't get carried away... Argh. She played me like a fiddle._Annette: Ingrid...\nIngrid: What's the matter Annette? You look upset.\nAnnette: I'm just so sorry. I had no idea!\nIngrid: I'm not sure I follow. Take a breath. What's going on?\nAnnette: Well, I was really curious about why you're not interested in things like makeup. So I asked some of our friends about it...and...\nIngrid: Oh, I see, I imagine they mentioned that my family was fairly poor, and they probably also mentioned that I lost my fiancé, Correct?\nAnnette: They did. I'm so sorry. It was so thoughtless of me to try pushing those things on you.\nIngrid: It's perfectly fine, Annette. It's true my family struggled financially. It wasn't easy growing up, but it taught me values I wouldn't have learned otherwise. And we weren't so poor that I consider myself deprived. I'm sure my family would've bought me makeup if I wanted it. But it never mattered enough to me— not then, and not now.\nAnnette: Oh. So you just...never sought that stuff out?\nIngrid: Never. While I acknowledge it can be fun, fussing over my outward appearance isn't an instinct of mine. When I was younger, I'd usually be found covered in dirt, bugs in my hair, and a big smile on my face. Things haven't changed too much since. Then, when my fiancé passed on, my priorities shifted even further. It reminded me of what's most important in life. Beyond that...it's hard to think of myself changing without him around to see it, even if it's something trivial like how I present myself. But talking to you has helped me realize it's OK to loosen up and enjoy those things if I want. So...thank you.\nAnnette: Me? Oh, I didn't do anything at all. Except pester.\nIngrid: More importantly... Do you notice anything different about me today?\nAnnette: Yes! It's very subtle, but I could tell right away that you were using that makeup that I gave you!\nIngrid: You could? Ah, that makes me happy. I was trying to apply it just how you showed me.\nAnnette: You did great, and it really suits you.\nIngrid: I think there's a lot I can learn from you, Annette. You've helped me embrace a lighter side of life I quite like.\nAnnette: It's my pleasure. Oh, this is so great! Want to go shopping to celebrate?\nIngrid: Uh, shopping? But...what would we buy? That sounds so overwhelming!\nAnnette: There's a dress I've been eyeing for a while now. I'm certain it will complement your pretty eyes. Just leave it to me, Ingrid. I'll make you the most fabulous knight this world has ever seen!\nIngrid: Well that does sound fun! I look forward to it._null_null_null_null_
3_30_Annette: Hi hi, Lysithea! When are you going to teach me magic? Is now good?\nLysithea: Why do I have to?\nAnnette: Why? Because you're way better at it than me, silly!\nLysithea: Is that so. I thought you were something of an honors student at the school of sorcery?\nAnnette: Well, sure... But I wouldn't say I've got any kind of natural talent for it. I'm going to have to try very hard to become as as good off a mage as you are!\nLysithea: What is that supposed to mean? Are you implying that I don't work hard too? If you think my skills are inherent, you are sorely mistaken.\nAnnette: No! I wasn't saying that at all! Everyone knows how hard you work. I just meant that if I want to be as good as you, I'll have to work really, incredibly hard!\nLysithea: Hm. And what is it you want to learn about?\nAnnette: Oh! So you'll teach me? Thank you so much! Um, actually...\n(They both study)\n\nAnnette: Oh, I get it now! I never though about it that way before!\nLysithea: Look at how quickly you're picking this up. You're clearly very skilled already.\nAnnette: Don't be silly. You're just that good of a teacher! Your way of looking at the world is so fundamentally different from mine\nLysithea: Do you insist on taking the conversation in that direction?\nAnnette: Oh no, I'm sorry! I wasn't doing that! There I go, saying the wrong thing again.\nLysithea: It's fine. Let's just drop it. A bit more self-confidence would go a long way for you, Annette.\nAnnette: Huh?\nLysithea: That's all I've got for you today. I need to get going now. Lots to do.\nAnnette: Oh, I'm sorry to take up your time! Thanks again for teaching me!_Lysithea: Oh, you're still here?\nAnnette: Lysithea! Hi! Did you forget something?\nLysithea: I did. What are you reading?\nAnnette: Just something I found. Though there are things in here I don't quite get.\nLysithea: Is that The Compendium of Light and Dark?\nAnnette: It is! Amazing how you could tell that just from a glance at the cover.\nLysithea: I've read it so many times I have nearly the entire thing memorized. That said, it does seem to take some liberties with some topics, so be aware of that while you're reading it.\nAnnette: Wait, really? Yikes! Thanks for the warning.\nLysithea: You've got quite the stack of books here for only wanting to brush up on one thing. I knew you were a hard worker, Annette.\nAnnette: No, not as much as some people. I'm... Oh! Sorry. There I go again.\nLysithea: It's all right. In getting to know you, I've taken some time to self-reflect. I used to think that I worked harder than anyone. But I'm not so sure anymore. I have to work even harder to keep pace with you!\nAnnette: Oh no! But then I'll have to work extra, extra hard to keep up with you!\nLysithea: Well, if you work extra, extra hard, I'll need to work super duper extra hard!\nAnnette: Aw, come on! Fine. Super duper quadruple extra hard it is!\nLysithea: OK, OK. That's enough. We could do this forever, but we've got better things to do.\nAnnette: Heh, sorry. It's fun to see you get carried away like that though.\nLysithea: I'm glad we had this chat. I feel excited to continue working super duper extra hard now. I'm lucky to have someone like you around to inspire me.\nAnnette: I feel the same. I'll do my best to keep pace with you!\nLysithea: Why are you smiling?\nAnnette: Oh, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how nice it is that we can motivate each other like this.\nLysithea: It is nice, isn't it? But I still intend to surpass you.\nAnnette: Nuh-uh! I'm gonna surpass you! But before that... Uh, could you explain this part of the book to me?\nLysithea: I'm not quite sure how someone of your caliber is struggling with this one, but let me break it down for you..._null_null_null_null_
3_22_Annette: Hilda! I'm coming in!\nHilda: Hey, Annette. Don't mind the mess.\nAnnette: Haha! Oh, wow. It really is messy. I'm not sure there's even enough room to breathe.\nHilda: I haven't been tidying lately. I start to procrastinate when I'm busy.\nAnnette: Oh... Hey, how about I clean up for you?\nHilda: Really? That would be amazing! So, are you good at cleaning?\nAnnette: I love it! Actually, the messier a room is, the more determined I get to conquer the crud!\nHilda: Works for me! I'll leave you to it. Don't wanna get in your way.\nAnnette: Great! See you later!\nScene change\nAnnette: Awaaaah!\nHilda: Annette?! Oh no, my vase!\nAnnette: Oh my goodness! I'm so, so sorry! I'll clean it up right— Ahhh!\nHilda: Not again!\nAnnette: Th-there was a big bug! So big...\nHilda: Oh no! Oh no—oh no—oh no! Annette, do something! Wait! Not magic! I don't want you to burn my room down!\n(Scene transition)\n\nAnnette: I'm so terribly sorry, Hilda. I wanted to clean up for you, but I basically did the opposite...\nHilda: No kidding. I guess it was my fault for getting you to clean up my mess. At any rate, you've made such a mess of my mess, now I feel motivated to clean my own room. So, that's kind of a positive outcome.\nAnnette: I guess that's one way to think of it...\nHilda: You know, I really admire your can-do attitude. Although, it might be, ah, too much? You don't want to overextend yourself. For one thing, you'll tire yourself out. Based on what I just saw, you might even get hurt.\nAnnette: Don't worry about me! I'm fine! I've been like this my whole life. I've never wanted to let anyone down. My parents, my uncle... So I always try to give it my all. And it's taken me this far, at least!\nHilda: I guess so. But going all-out to please others, never thinking of yourself... That's no way to live._Annette: Ooh, you're keeping your room really tidy these days, Hilda!\nHilda: I'm pretty good at cleaning, I found out. I guess I was being lazy before. I figured that if I left it to somebody else, I might lose another vase.\nAnnette: Heh, I'm sorry again about that. And about all of the other things I knocked over too...\nHilda: Yeah. The shelves and the chairs and my clothes and my makeup...\nAnnette: Ah! I'm sorry! I said I'm sorry! I put everything back, didn't I?!\nHilda: I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You know, Annette, you should try to be a little more selfish.\nAnnette: Huh? That was a quick change of subject!\nHilda: You said how hard you've been working not to disappoint your family. You cleaned my room, or tried to, because I was feeling overwhelmed. You're always taking on other people's burdens.\nAnnette: Hmm... You might be right. It could be nice to do something for myself sometime. But if I hadn't tried hard for other people's sakes, maybe I wouldn't have tried at all. I might not have made it this far. So really, I don't regret a thing. Who I am now is the sum of everything I've done.\nHilda: You're so soft-hearted, Annette.\nAnnette: You really think so?\nHilda: I didn't mean it as a compliment. But anyway, I just thought of something you can do for me. You can take a nap with me.\nAnnette: A nap? But I'm not done with my chores...\nHilda: Yeah. I could use a little shut-eye, and it feels nice to snuggle up with someone. So, why don't we lie down for a bit?\n(screen fades to black)\n\nAnnette: Are you sure it's OK to nap right now? I still have stuff to do for the professor...\nHilda: Oh, it's fine, it's fine. Later, I'll help you with your stuff, and it'll be done in no time.\nAnnette: Oh, fine. Just for a bit. The sunlight coming through the window is awfully nice...\nHilda: Isn't it? Nothing better than a nice lazy nap in the middle of the day.\nAnnette: Mmhmm. It really is... relaxing...\nAnnette: Zzz Zzz Zzz\nHilda: Already dozing! She must have needed this nap really bad. I'm feeling a little drowsy myself. Sleep well, Annette..._null_null_null_null_
3_20_Hanneman: And that should explain it. Did you understand all of that, young Annette?\nAnnette: I did! Thank you very much! Oh, but I was also wondering about this part here... It seems a bit off.\nHanneman: Questioning something like this is proof that your understanding has grown. Most impressive. Sit there, and I'll put this on the blackboard so you may copy it into your notes for later study.\nAnnette: Wonderful! I can't wait!\n(screen fades to black, then back in)\n\nHanneman: I believe that should explain everything, yes? Any further questions?\nAnnette: None! Thank you so much! Ah, I feel so great. I'm really sorry for taking up so much of your time though...\nHanneman: Not at all! Not at all. You intellectual curiosity is marvelous to see. And you have a top-notch character. Keep on as you are, and I sense a bright future for you. Seeing you continue to grow and succeed is more than a humble professor, like myself, deserves.\nAnnette: Really? That's so nice of you to say! I'll do my best! I'm honored to be your student.\nHanneman: If only your friends would learn from your example. Yes, a classroom full of attentive, studious pupils would be quite refreshing after all these years. Have a good evening, Miss Annette. And do not hesitate to ask any other questions.\nAnnette: I won't, thank you! Good-bye for now!\nHanneman: Wait! You'll trip if you leave like that!\nAnnette: Ahh! I'm sorry! Thank you!_Hanneman: Thank you for volunteering to clean this room, Miss Annette. Most appreciated.\nAnnette: Don't worry about it. It's the least I can do to repay you for all you've taught me. It seems like a small payment, honestly. I wish I could do more!\nHanneman: In that case, I have nothing to worry about. Do make sure you get the bookshelf as well. Be thorough.\nAnnette: The bookshelf? But it's not even dusty...\nHanneman: Dirt always lurks in the places you can't see. Best of luck on your hunt!\nAnnette: Oh, OK! Leave it to me! Whoa! There are a lot of rare books here...\nHanneman: Miss Annette! Please stop jumping on the stool. You'll tumble down and crack your skull.\nAnnette: Huh? Whoa!\nHanneman: Miss Annette! Are you all right? Can you stand?\nAnnette: Yes... I'm fine... Sorry...\nHanneman: What a blessing neither the books nor yourself came to any harm. Here, I'll help you clear them up. Oh, my... The inside of this bookshelf is quite filthy.\nAnnette: So dirt was lurking in the places we couldn't see, just like you said!\nHanneman: And we found it thanks to the books falling. Every cloud has a dusty lining.\nAnnette: This dirt is really bothersome...\nHanneman: Agreed! Shall we endeavor to get rid of it together?\nAnnette: You can count on me!\nHanneman: Steady. Don't go leaping about in your enthusiasm!_Annette: I'm so sorry for always taking up your time, Professor Hanneman...\nHanneman: Nonsense. I told you to come to me any time you needed help. Nothing to be sorry about at all. So what can I help you with today, Miss Annette?\nAnnette: Hm? Oh, uh... nothing in particular.\nHanneman: Perhaps not related to your studies, but I sense something else troubles you.\nAnnette: You see right through me, Professor Hanneman. OK. Here goes. The truth is... I've been wondering what I'll do when the war finally comes to an end.\nHanneman: Your marks at both the school of sorcery and the military academy were exceptional. You have many, many options. The only trouble I see for you is in picking which one to chase.\nAnnette: You've hit the nail on the head. There's so much I want to do, I feel completely lost...\nHanneman: Lost, hmm? It seems to me that you're just lacking in decisiveness.\nAnnette: You think so?\nHanneman: For example, I've already been considering my own future, once this war ends at last. I think I might leave Garreg Mach. I've spent a great deal of time researching Crests, both in the Empire and at the monastery. Fódlan is large, with much to see and learn. It would be a shame to spend all my years in too few places.\nAnnette: But where will you go?\nHanneman: That's the question, isn't it? I've considered the school of sorcery in Fhirdiad. It would be good to get a new viewpoint on Crest research. There are certainly discoveries to be made. However, new places are daunting. Yet I'd have no complaints if I had a former student as an apprentice. Say, a former student who is brimming with curiosity, talented at magic, and as tidy as myself?\nAnnette: You don't mean me, do you?!\nHanneman: I was merely expressing a possibility. It all depends on your own feelings and interests.\nAnnette: I have considered that it might be nice to be a professor like you... But I'm such a scatterbrain! And I make mistakes all the time, so I'm not confident I can manage...\nHanneman: Those are but minor side notes compared to your wonderful qualities, Miss Annette. You are serious in your studies and possessing of excellent character. You surpass even myself.\nAnnette: Do you really think so? Maybe I can do it after all...\nHanneman: I truly feel you could, yes. You could accompany me to Fhirdiad. I think that would be most splendid, don't you?\nAnnette: I feel like, with your guidance, I could excel anywhere!\nHanneman: First, though, we must put an end to this war. The future cannot begin until we achieve victory.\nAnnette: That's true! I'm going to try my hardest to make sure that happens!\nHanneman: I know you will, Miss Annette. You have my full support._Annette: Hm. There's a lot of dust here... It looks like nobody's cleaned it in ages. Oh, I can't just leave it! It must be cleaned! Urgh... Gah... Ohh! Can't...quite...reach... Just a little...further... If only...I was...taller...\nHanneman: Miss Annette! If you carry on like that, I daresay the bookshelf shall give out in a few moment's time.\nAnnette: Professor Hanneman! Phew! Thank you so much! There was just so much dust up there...\nHanneman: I understand. I had noticed it myself, actually, and was just on my way to get a cloth for it. How about you leave this part to me?\nAnnette: OK! Thank you!\nHanneman: No need to thank me. I must admit, I'm rather impressed by your keen dust-spotting eye.\nAnnette: I just couldn't rest easy thinking that we hadn't finished cleaning in here.\nHanneman: I'm quite the same. How anyone can abide dust—even hidden dust—well, I can't grasp the idea.\nAnnette: You and I are like two peas in a pod! Oh, I'm sorry. That's a bit rude of me...\nHanneman: We do seem to be similar in a number of ways, yes? So I have a spot of advice for you, if you don't mind.\nAnnette: Yes?\nHanneman: Next time you identify a dusty patch in an inaccessible location... please send for me?\nAnnette: That's very kind, but I wouldn't want to bother someone as busy as you!\nHanneman: Nonsense! I'm keen to avoid a repeat performance of the Tragedy of Miss Annette and the Books.\nAnnette: Oh gosh, I'm so sorry about that... Right. Next time, I'll definitely call for you!\nHanneman: Indeed. I would never forgive myself if you managed to pull a whole bookcase over on yourself.\nAnnette: I promise that won't happen! Most likely!_B+_null_
3_19_Annette: Father! Father! Why do you pretend not to recognize me?!\nGilbert: Annette...I—\nAnnette: I've been looking everywhere for you. Please stop treating me like a stranger. I can't bear it!\nGilbert: …\nAnnette: Father, wait! How long will you keep avoiding me like this?!\nGilbert: I have lost the right to face you or your mother.\nAnnette: This has nothing to do with rights! We're family, I'm your daughter.\nGilbert: Indeed, you are my daughter. Yet I am no father. I am only a fool who abandoned his family.\nAnnette: You really think it was foolish to abandon us?\nGilbert: I do.\nAnnette: Then the least you can do is apologize. I'm fine, but Mother deserves as much. I've finished my studies at the school of sorcery and entered the Officers Academy. I have a busy and satisfying life now. But Mother... She's waited for you to return all this time, living under my uncle's roof.\nGilbert: I... I am sorry, Annette.\nAnnette: I already told you. Don't say that to me. Apologize to Mother! Let her see your face!\nGilbert: That I cannot do. I know you do not understand, but it is the way of things. As for you, Annette. Say the word, and I will disappear from your life forever. For now though, I must return to my duties.\n(Gilbert leaves)\n\nAnnette: Father... How could you be so cruel..._Annette: What's wrong, Father? I didn't expect you to summon me...\nGilbert: I carved this on a whim. I wish for you to take it, Annette.\nAnnette: A wooden doll... You used to make these for me when I was a child.\nGilbert: I still do it. When the mood strikes.\nAnnette: It's so cute! It's...wait. No. What do you want from me?\nGilbert: I want nothing. I was carving and... I thought of you. I remembered how happy you would be, as a child, when I handed one of these dolls to you.\nAnnette: I was back then, but I'm not a child anymore. It's too late for this now, Father. It doesn't make me happy anymore.\nGilbert: Annette...\nAnnette: I... I was so lonely after you left. I was always, always alone. I didn't know where you were, or who to turn to for comfort. All I could do was look at the dolls you carved for me, and remember you...and weep!\nGilbert: If you don't need it, you can throw it away. It is all the same in the end. I am sorry, Annette. I should have given more thoughts to my actions.\n(Gilbert leaves)\n\nAnnette: Father, wait! No, this won't do at all. It would be better to throw this doll away.\nAnnette: …\nAnnette: You are too cruel, Father. Of course I... I could never throw it away..._Annette: Praying, Father?\nGilbert: Yes. Praying is all I can do. For I am at fault for each death upon the cursed plain of Duscur.\nAnnette: You keep saying it's your fault, Father, but you're wrong. His Highness doesn't blame you. Neither does King Lambert, I'm sure of it. But... I guess that's not the issue for you, is it?\nGilbert: It was my duty to protect the royal family. I should have given my life to protect the king. Even if His Highness has forgiven me, my knightly vows are still broken. My knighthood is lost.\nAnnette: That's obvious from looking at you, Father. I think Mother understood it as well. But before fleeing the country, I wish you had thought about your family, if only for a moment. Even if the whole world had condemned you, we would always have been your allies...\nGilbert: I am sorry, Annette.\nAnnette: No, I told you before. I don't particularly want you to apologize.\nGilbert: Annette...\nAnnette: Yes, Father?\nGilbert: Take this.\nAnnette: A bundle of letters... There are so many...\nGilbert: Look inside and you will understand. Should the contents make you sad, please burn them.\n(Gilbert leaves)\n\nAnnette: Father! Oh, for the love of... He's done it again! But what have we here... Hm, just as I thought. Letters for me and Mother. And so many... But why, and how? I suppose I'll have to read them if I hope to find my answers._Annette: Hello, Father. May I have a moment?\nGilbert: Of course.\nAnnette: I...I read all your letters. You never stopped writing them, did you?\nGilbert: …\nAnnette: My birthday. Mother's birthday. Every possible occasion, without fail...\nGilbert: Yes.\nAnnette: So why didn't you send any of them? If you had sent even one, we would have...\nGilbert: Each time I thought to send one, I could not do so. Such behavior belittled my penance. Time passed, and with it my feelings of guilt toward you and your mother grew. Even though I wrote the letters, I could not send them.\nAnnette: I would always talk about it with Mother... If only he'd write us, at least one, we'd say. We waited and waited...all those long years.\nGilbert: I am sorry.\nAnnette: I'm tired of hearing it, so just stop. Your apologies change nothing! Send those letters to Mother. She'll be happy to hear from you.\nGilbert: I cannot.\nAnnette: In that case, why don't I send them?\nGilbert: I have given them to you. They are yours to do with as you wish.\nAnnette: All right then, I'll send them. You don't get to take it back afterwards. Father... You should know that they made me happy.\nGilbert: Happy?\nAnnette: Knowing that you were thinking of us all along. We were worried about you, Mother and I. Neither of us ever came out and said it, but... We thought maybe you hated us, were trying to forget all about us...\nGilbert: Never. I swear it on his late majesty, and on my homeland.\nAnnette: I see. All right...then swear. Swear that some day, when this war is over, you'll come back to us.\nGilbert: I hear you, Annette. I will return without fail.\nAnnette: No matter what. That's a promise you just made. If you break it, I'll never speak to you again.\nGilbert: Yes. I promise.\nAnnette: Great! Now I'm positively elated! I can't wait until we're all a family again!\nGilbert: I look forward to it, Annette. More than anything._A+_null_
