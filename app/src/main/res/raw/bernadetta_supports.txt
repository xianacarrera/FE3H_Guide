6_41_(Bernadetta is speaking with a woman)\n\nWoman: Thank you, Lady Bernadetta. I will take my leave.\nBernadetta: Oh, good. Bye! Uh, good-bye!\n(The woman leaves)\n\nBernadetta: Finally...Oh, that was awful. Just terrifying.\n(Byleth arrives)\n\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What's going on?\nChoice 2: What's terrifying?\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: Ah! Please don't sneak up on me like that! That lady asked me to show her around! I tried to be polite but strangers are just so nerve-racking.\nChoice 2 response: Ah! Please don't sneak up on me like that! It was nothing big. That lady just wanted me to show her around a bit. But strangers are just so nerve-racking.\nByleth: You've never seemed scared of me.\nBernadetta:\n(Black Eagles) Oh yeah? How about when I first met you and I wouldn't come out of the corner or even uncover my face? Actually, now that you mention it, it's funny. Once I started talking to you, I stopped feeling scared.\n(Other routes) Now that you mention it, I think you're right. I don't know if I ever have felt scared around you.\nBernadetta: I wonder why... You know, Professor, you might be the first person I've been able to speak to normally since I got here and I have no idea why.\nByleth: I'm glad, regardless.\nBernadetta: I'm happy about it too! When we first started out here, we had to do drills...outside. I skipped those every chance I got. It's a terrible idea— going out in the forest with all these people you don't even know! Thanks to you, though, I can actually make it through class now. I'm grateful for that. I don't know what I'd do...if you weren't here...\nByleth: It's all right.\nBernadetta: Sorry... I'm OK... I am OK. I'm doing just fine. I feel safe here, thanks to you.\nByleth: By the way, was that you singing in the greenhouse?\nBernadetta: What? Y-you saw that? Why would you see that?! You were watching me?! That crosses the line, Professor! Singing? Me?! Why would I be singing? I'd never be singing! Ah! I've never been so humiliated!\n(Bernadetta runs away)\n\nBernadetta: (Off-screen) Useless! Worthless! Unmarriageable! Augh!\nByleth: …_Bernadetta: Great weather today. Perfect for shutting yourself inside, don't you think?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I think I'll head outside, actually.\nChoice 2: Definitely.\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: Oh, you go right ahead. I'll be right here. The better the weather, the less crowded it is in here. I can't pass up having all this space to myself.\nChoice 2 response: I'm glad you get it. With great weather like this, there'll be no one inside to bother us.\nBernadetta: I love feeling like I'm all alone in the world...\nByleth: What made you such a recluse?\nBernadetta: Oh, that. Well, I guess I can tell you, Professor. My father's obsessed with money. He's only ever seen me as bait for a rich husband. To train me to be a good, submissive wife, he'd do things like tie me to a chair and leave me there all day, challenging me to stay quiet. I tried hard to do as he asked. Honestly, I did. But before I knew it, I just couldn't bring myself to leave my room anymore.\nUpdate: Oh, that. Well, I guess I can tell you, Professor. My father's obsessed with money. He's only ever seen me as bait for a rich husband. To train me to be a good wife, he'd do things like tie me to a chair. I tried hard to do as he asked. Honestly, I did. But before I knew it, I just couldn't bring myself to leave my room anymore.\nByleth: Why not?\nBernadetta: I just had this overwhelming feeling of fear all the time. No matter how hard I tried, my father never thought I was good enough. After that, it was just constant scolding. He couldn't say two words to me without mentioning how useless I was. An unmarriageable girl. My life was isolated to say the least. I wasn't allowed to play with other kids, let alone make friends. Soon, I stopped wanting that. I was happiest alone. But even that made him mad. And when he tried to drag me outside, I kicked and screamed so much I seriously hurt myself. He's calmed down a bit in recent years. His constant torment was replaced with complete indifference. He mostly acts like I don't exist now.\nByleth: How did you end up at the monastery?\nBernadetta: If you can believe it, I was basically kidnapped. My mother ordered an attendant to stuff me in a bag while I was sleeping. By the time I figured out what was going on, I was already here. For a while, I was sure I was going to die. But here I am. Look at me...still breathing. Ah, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get you down, talking like that about my past! Just forget everything I told you. There's no point in talking about myself anyway. (To herself) Idiot! Oh this is why everyone hates you, Bernie!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Don't worry about it.\nChoice 2: Thank you for confiding in me.\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: You're the only one who would ever say such a kind thing to me, Professor...\nChoice 2 response: What? N-no, it's not... Oh, Professor! How can you be so kind to me?! I don't deserve it...\nBernadetta: I'm sorry! Please don't look at me!_Bernadetta: I can't believe how long it's been since I left home. Since I was dragged out of the house, I mean. Five whole years. It's weird to think about.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Weird in what way?\nChoice 2: Do you want to go back?\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: At first, I remember I was desperate to go back, but now, it's the opposite.\nChoice 2 response: No! But if you'd asked me that five years ago, I'd have said the opposite.\nBernadetta: I have friends here, and I have you. The monastery's become a second home to me. Back then, I never would've dreamed a day like this would come.\nByleth: I'm happy for you.\nBernadetta: It's all thanks to you! You've given me a second chance at life! If not for you, I never would have gotten used to leaving my room, let alone the monastery. Maybe the battlefield's just dulled my senses. I'm much better with strangers and new places now though. I don't panic nearly as much as before.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Could you go somewhere new by yourself?\nChoice 2: I have some independent work for you, then.\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: A new place? All on my own?\nChoice 2 response: What? Independent? As in, alone?\nBernadetta: That sounds like a tough assignment. Where did this come from all of a sudden? Hey, hold on... You're teasing me, aren't you?! Please don't joke around like that anymore! It's torture for me!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: All right, all right.\nChoice 2 response: I can't commit to that...\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: You're still not taking me seriously! I mean it.\nChoice 2 response: Come on, Professor! I'm begging you!\nBernadetta: Promise me you won't do that again! Friends respect each other's feelings, don't they?\nByleth: OK. I promise.\nBernadetta: Good... I'll hold you to that. You're absolutely not allowed to send me out anywhere on my own! Got it? You would need to come with me. If you're with me, I can go anywhere in the world.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'll follow you at a distance.\nChoice 2: I'll be with you in spirit.\nChoice 3: We can ask another professor.\nBernadetta: No, that defeats the purpose! Why can't you get what I'm saying?! Oh, that's enough. I need some time alone..._null_null_Bernadetta: The Goddess Tower? What are we doing here? This is it... We're all alone... The perfect time... You're going to kill me, aren't you?!\nByleth: I would never do that.\nBernadetta: All right, I've made my peace, and for what it's worth, I'm glad it's— Wait, you wouldn't? Of course you wouldn't. I'm not even worth killing, am I? I knew it all along. I'll go lock myself away now...\nByleth: I love you, Bernie. I want you to have this.\nBernadetta: Wh-what did you just say? Is that...a ring?! Well, um... This is, um... What kind of ring is this? When a man gives a woman a ring, it usually only means... Is that what this means? I...I don't know what to say! I accept! Of course I accept! This means...I'll be able to shut myself away in peace again. You can go off doing your hero things, and I'll hold down the fort!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Don't I get a say in this?!\nChoice 2: That's not happening.\nBernadetta:\nChoice 1 response: What?! Don't tell me you'll want me to keep leaving the house! Fine, but in that case, I have a favor to ask.\nChoice 2 response: No, come on, please! You just won't let me off the hook, will you? In that case, I have a favor to ask.\nBernadetta: There's a reason I've been able to cope with going out of the monastery so much. It's because I've been with you. I'll never completely get over my anxiety...or my fear of strangers...or my compulsive need to run and hide. So whenever you tell me to go outside, I want you to come with me. Wherever we go, whatever we do...I want us to be together, always.\nByleth: That sounds perfect.\nBernadetta: Because when I'm with you, I feel... Wait. Did you agree? You mean it?! Ah, you're the greatest! I...I love you so much! We're going to be so happy together!

6_15_Edelgard: …\nBernadetta: …\nEdelgard: Bernadetta, why are you following me?\nBernadetta: Ah! Um...\nEdelgard: You were following me quite conspicuously, so why attempt to hide now?\nBernadetta: I... Um...\nEdelgard: Um?\nBernadetta: Ah! Please don't hurt me!\nEdelgard: Calm yourself. I have no reason to harm you.\nBernadetta: Forgive me! I beg you! I'll go straight back to my room and you'll never see me again. I swear!\nEdelgard: Bernadetta.\nBernadetta: Yes, Lady Edelgard.\nEdelgard: Please explain why you were following me, and why you tried to hide.\nBernadetta: Is Her Highness saying she will not condemn me?\nEdelgard: Please speak like the human you are. I already said no harm will come to you.\nBernadetta: Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. Um, permit me to explain. Lady Edelgard, you are fearless. I look up to you as an example to follow.\nEdelgard: And that explains it...how?\nBernadetta: I decided to watch you from a distance, to learn from you. But your presence is, um...intimidating. I got more and more scared until I finally couldn't help but try to hide! Ah, forgive me. I throw myself upon your mercy!\nEdelgard: Honestly. Look, nobody is truly fearless. Even I have things that I'm afraid of.\nBernadetta: What? You do?\nEdelgard: You seem oddly overjoyed at the thought.\nBernadetta: N-no, of course not! But, um, what in the world could possibly frighten you?\nEdelgard: The sea. I find the pitch black of the open sea at night quite frightening. I can't swim, so if the sea were to wash me away, I fear I would never return.\nBernadetta: The sea? I think I may have seen it once. Maybe... I didn't know you couldn't swim. That's a surprise.\nEdelgard: Again, my shortcomings delight you. Everyone has fears, as well as things they can't do. How many times must I tell you?\nBernadetta: Ah! I really did make you angry!_Edelgard: Bernadetta.\nBernadetta: Ah! Lady Edelgard! Wh-what can I do for you?\nEdelgard: I appreciate all the effort you're making to overcome your fear of me. Your dedication is commendable. However...\nBernadetta: I'm just getting in your way, aren't I? Knew it, Bernie. You're just an intruder. Nobody wants you around! Stupid! Oh...\nEdelgard: Bernadetta!\nBernadetta: Yes!\nEdelgard: The problem you keep running into is that you don't listen to what people are really saying. That's why your efforts are in vain. You need to listen instead of jumping to your own conclusions.\nBernadetta: …\nEdelgard: Are you...listening to me?\nBernadetta: Yes!\nEdelgard: Then why aren't you responding?\nBernadetta: Um... I wanted to listen until you were finished. Ah, sorry! Were you finished then?\nEdelgard: I was.\nBernadetta: Then, may I please scream now?\nEdelgard: By all means. But please try to make it a fairly quiet one.\nBernadetta: Just a tiny one.\nEdelgard: …\nBernadetta: Um, wait. What was I upset about, again? That's weird. I forgot why I was about to scream, and now I don't even need to. What a nice feeling!\nEdelgard: You're trying your best. I know that. But even so—\nBernadetta: B-but what? What'd I do this time? I'm so sorry! Whatever it is! I'll go to my room and never bother you again!\nEdelgard: Wait, you didn't let me finish! I was only going to say that—\nBernadetta: Aaaah!_Bernadetta: Gardening with you is a lot of fun, Lady Edelgard!\nEdelgard: I feel the same. You know so much about it, Bernadetta.\nBernadetta: I looked after flowers a lot back home. I like them. They don't talk... They don't get angry... They don't hit you. And they're sweet.\nEdelgard: They are sweet. Unlike people, they can all be trusted on sight.\nBernadetta: You're sweet too, Lady Edelgard! I mean—not sweet, but, um... You know what I mean. You can talk or even get angry all you want...\nEdelgard: Well, I'll strive to avoid getting angry.\nBernadetta: You're really kind. I'm less scared of you than I used to be. Most nobles are terrifying. I've had lots of bad experiences with them. But getting the chance to talk to you like this makes me glad I came to the monastery.\nEdelgard: I'm glad too. I had heard about the reclusive daughter of House Varley, but you're nothing like I imagined.\nBernadetta: Rumors? About me?! Uh, just...pretend you didn't hear anything!\nEdelgard: Heh, there's no need to be embarrassed! Rumors are meaningless. All that matters is the truth.\nBernadetta: You're right! I'm not really a recluse now anyway, not since I came to the monastery. I won't let the rumors bother me.\nEdelgard: I'm happy to hear it. Actually...I should thank you.\nBernadetta: Thank me? What for? Wait, do you mean you need to \"thank\" me for all the times I've made you mad?! You do, don't you?!\nEdelgard: That mind of yours—no! I mean the grateful sort of thanks. Before I met you, I was more prone to anger. But now I've changed in that regard. So thank you for that. Oh... I suppose you're not listening.\nBernadetta: Oh, I'm done for! Five years' worth of resentment is about to crash down on me all at once! Aaaah!\nEdelgard: It's OK, Bernadetta. I'm thanking you, not attacking you.\nBernadetta: Oh. Um... I jumped to conclusions again, didn't I?\nEdelgard: You did, yes. But don't worry about it. Enough talk, don't you think? Let's take care of these sweet little plants.\nBernadetta: Right! OK. Thank you!\nEdelgard: Bernadetta... I hope you'll keep spending time with me.\nBernadetta: Of course I will! Hey, look! This flower's just about ready to bloom.\nEdelgard: Ha! So it is! I can't wait to see its true colors..._null_null_null_
6_23_Bernadetta: Being outside is so tiring. Tomorrow's got to be just an inside day, Bernie.\nHubert: …\nBernadetta: Whoa, why is it so cold all of a sudden? It's as if an unspeakable evil just— Ah!\n(The camera cuts to another angle, where Hubert is standing behind Bernadetta)\n\nHubert: You're late.\nBernadetta: No, into the light! Back to the beyond from whence you came!\nHubert: Are you telling me to die?\nBernadetta: (stuttering) Ah— Hubert!\nHubert: In the flesh. I came to ask you something.\nBernadetta: Oh no! What'd I do? Think, Bernie, think.\nHubert: There have been sightings of a sinister figure, carrying a sharp object, wandering the halls at night.\nBernadetta: Um...\nHubert: A strange giggle, the glimmer of a needle in the dark. The sound of a door creaking open and closed.\nBernadetta: Uh, I was embroidering.\nHubert: I suspected as much. Then you leave me no choice.\nBernadetta: Wh-What?! No, I'm too young to die! I've got so much left to do, PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!!!\n(Bernadetta runs off.)\n\nHubert: About what I expected.\n(Hubert follows Bernadetta at a walking speed. The scene fades to another location where Hubert has caught up with Bernie.)\n\nBernadetta: It's no good... I can't run anymore!\nHubert: That was quite a sprint. A shame you lack stamina. Now, to my duty.\nBernadetta: You're going to execute me, aren't you? Please, let me compose my last will and testament! Or at least a swan song? The creak of a door... Sorrow like a needlepoint... Bernie's gone away.\nHubert: Bernadetta, a word of caution. How would you feel if you fell or bumped into someone while carrying around that needle? Please watch where you're going in the future.\n(Bernadetta says nothing, which is displayed as \"...\", having a case of stage fright.)\n\nHubert: How did you manage to faint while standing up? (sighs) Well I cannot simply leave her here.\n(The scene fades out.)_Bernadetta: G-good morning! The w-weather is nice today. So, um... It's, ah, really nice weather we're having. Isn't it?\nHubert: Indeed. Did you want something?\nBernadetta: I just, ah... I'm really sorry!\nHubert: I can't accept your apology until I know what it's for.\nBernadetta: Oh... Good point. I'm sorry I said you were terrifying.\nHubert: Is that all? I'm used to that. No apology necessary.\nBernadetta: B-but you've been avoiding me since then, right? You even stopped doing your deathly grin.\nHubert: I am merely trying not to frighten you. Is there something wrong with that?\nBernadetta: Um, it's not working. And yes, there is. You can't quit talking and laughing just to try to make me feel better. That's not really fair. I need to master my own fear!\nHubert: Is that right?\nBernadetta: Yes. R-right.\nHubert: Haha...Hahaha!\nBernadetta: Ah! Why?!\nHubert: You told me not to forgo laughing. So I laughed as hard as I could. Is it helping to conquer your fear?\nBernadetta: Yes. I mean, someday it might...maybe. Ah! I'm not ready!_Hubert: A summons from Bernadetta? How historic.\nBernadetta: Um, I've got something to give you.\nHubert: Do you? What is it?\nBernadetta: A token of apology for all of the rude stuff I've said. It's, um... It's only right. I hope this will help you let go of all the grudges you're probably holding against me!\nHubert: There are no grudges, but very well. I'll accept it.\nBernadetta: You will? Great! Here you go!\nHubert: Some kind of embroidery. A flower. This is certainly lovely, but why give it to me? It seems like something you would send to a female friend or someone you had romantic feelings for.\nBernadetta: But it's, um, lovely you said, right? That's why. If you wear it, maybe you'll look less, um... terrifying.\nHubert: You would like me to wear this?\nBernadetta: Ah! You hate it, don't you?! I knew it. I knew you'd be angry... Ugh, I'm so sorry!\nHubert: Oh, why not. Do I put it here?\nHubert: Hmm, it really is quite nice. I cannot say that it suits me, but...\nBernadetta: No, it does! It looks great on you! Heh-heh...\nHubert: Hm...\nBernadetta: Um, sorry...\nHubert: Nothing else for it, I suppose. I dislike you laughing at me, but it is preferable, at least, to you fleeing in terror. Therefore, I will wear this when I am around you in the future.\nBernadetta: Really? You will? I'm so glad! But you're sure? You're really sure?\nHubert: If you're going to question me about it, perhaps I'll change my mind.\nBernadetta: No-no-no-no-no! I believe you. You're a lot less scary with it on.\nHubert: That is what's most important. Now I suppose it is safe for me to return to my usual strict methods.\nBernadetta: Ah! No, I'm not ready!\nHubert: This again..._Bernadetta: Um, Hubert?\nHubert: Yes?\nBernadetta: I just, um... I wanted to thank you. For the other day. You know, when I...fainted. Thank you for carrying me back to my room.\nHubert: That was nothing. It saved me effort in the long run. Leaving you there would have just caused even more trouble.\nBernadetta: I guess that's true. Well, thanks. There, I said it, and now I'm going.\nHubert: Is this why you've been circling me like a vulture for the last several hours?\nBernadetta: Uh, vulture's a bit— Well, yes.\nHubert: Yet you would have fled if I'd approached. It seems you will avoid me at almost any cost.\nBernadetta: Um... Well, that's—\nHubert: You don't need to say it. I know. I'm frightening. I'm told so often. (chuckles sinisterly)\nBernadetta: Ah! Please don't laugh like that!\nHubert: Apologies. I will be mindful not to laugh in your presence from now on.\nBernadetta: Ah! The grin of death itself! T-Terrifying...!\nHubert: You think so?\nBernadetta: Oh no, now you're angry too!\nHubert: Hardly. I'm sorry to have frightened you.\nBernadetta: No, you're not! It's a trick! You're lulling me into a false sense of security!\n(Bernadetta flees as she says...)\n\nBernadetta: Ah, I can't STAND IT!!\nHubert: (chuckles) She's a lost cause.\n(The scene fades out.)_C+_null_
6_17_Bernadetta: ♪ Hm hm-hm-hmm... ♪ Another fine day alone in my room, and plenty of books to read.\nFerdinand: Bernadetta, I have something to discuss with you.\nBernadetta: Um, what? I didn't do anything!\nFerdinand: No need to be defensive. I am not angry.\nBernadetta: Oh, you definitely are! I can tell! Just get it over with! What did I do?!\nFerdinand: You did not do anything wrong! Please listen. Look, just breathe, will you?\nBernadetta: Can't...breathe...too...scared!\nFerdinand: I see that you are struggling. Please calm down.\nBernadetta: Easy...for...you...to say!\nFerdinand: I just wanted to discuss how you are always hiding in your room. It seems like something must be troubling you, for you to shut yourself away like that. If something is the matter, maybe I can help. But you need to tell me what it is first.\nBernadetta: No! Um, no thanks. I'm fine! See, I'm breathing now. You fixed me. Can I go?\nFerdinand: Do you not realize that life is passing you by? Have you no desire to venture beyond this reclusive lifestyle? There is a whole world waiting for you out there. The social life of a noble is actually rather—\nBernadetta: Just stop it! I'm not interested!\nFerdinand: Bernadetta, this is unhealthy behavior. I beg you to take my hand. Otherwise, I will have to pick you up and carry you, and neither of us—\nBernadetta: What if I actually like being alone?! Is that so hard to imagine?! It's none of your business! Get lost!\nFerdinand: Aaagh!\nBernadetta: No... Oh no!\nFerdinand: Ah, ouch... I sprained my wrist...\nBernadetta: Oh, no-no-no-no. Now you've done it, Bernie. Now, you're his eternal rival.\nFerdinand: I do not wish to hurt you. Actually, I—\nBernadetta: No! I'm done for! You'll be the death of me for sure!\nFerdinand: Maybe I should just come back later..._Ferdinand: Bernadetta. If you have a moment, I would like to discuss what happened before.\nBernadetta: Ah, my nemesis! The hour of fate arrives... Help!\nFerdinand: I am not here to hurt you! You need not even open the door. Just listen to me.\nBernadetta: I...don't have to open the door? Is this a truce? OK. OK, I like truces!\nFerdinand: Thank you. I would like to apologize for sticking my nose into your business the way I did. I thought you might be unhappy all cooped up in there, and that maybe I could help. But I've had time to reflect on what you said, and I realize I was mistaken.\nBernadetta: Oh... Um, thanks for caring, but I'm fine actually.\nFerdinand: I see that. I suppose that is what I am trying to say. I should not have pushed you to do something that you did not wish to do. And for me to frighten you like that... That was unbecoming conduct for a noble.\nBernadetta: Maybe a little bit.\nFerdinand: Frankly, I am embarrassed by my behavior. I disgraced myself. As for my injury, you need not feel guilty or afraid. The sprain was a result of my own thoughtlessness, not anything you did. I have always strived to be a good person...but I suppose all that striving was for nothing. I have failed in my duty as a noble.\nBernadetta: Um, Ferdinand?\nFerdinand: Yes, Bernadetta?\nBernadetta: I don't really know much about this sort of thing... But you shouldn't say things like that about yourself! It wasn't all your fault, you know. I'm to blame too. I hurt you, and I'm sorry.\nFerdinand: Really, it is fine. It healed quickly.\nBernadetta: And...it wasn't for nothing either!\nFerdinand: I am not so sure.\nBernadetta: I do like my time alone. Actually, it's more of a need. But you're right. I also need to venture out every once in a while. Maybe if I work as hard as you do, I can try it a little more.\nFerdinand: Yes. Keep working at it. You are already much more outgoing than you used to be.\nBernadetta: When I mess up or even when it's just a bad day, it's hard for me to step outside. I'm too scared. But the next day, I try again...because I know that one mistake doesn't ruin everything. So you're still... I mean, just because you... That doesn't mean... Ah, I...don't know how to put it, but that's how it is. So, um... The end.\nFerdinand: What a graceful end to the conversation.\nBernadetta: Hey, come on! That was serious! Ugh, at least I got you to laugh._Ferdinand: Ah, even with the fires of war raging all around use, tea never fails to soothe the soul. Do you not agree, Bernadetta?\nBernadetta: Um, I hadn't thought about it, but...yes!\nFerdinand: Excellent! Oh, that reminds me...\nBernadetta: Hm? What's that?\nFerdinand: A long time ago, my parents were in talks to arrange my marriage with a certain young lady. She never set foot outside of her room, and she made little dolls to curse her perceived enemies. Such were the rumors. Frightened, I dissuaded my parents from going through with their plans.\nBernadetta: I can see that. She does sound pretty frightening. I relate to the staying in the room part though...\nFerdinand: That girl was you, Bernadetta. A daughter of House Varley.\nBernadetta: What?! I don't make dolls to curse people!\nFerdinand: You are a skilled embroiderer, no? I guess I was wrong. You were not making dolls.\nBernadetta: I did make dolls but cute ones! Nice little carnivorous plants and things!\nFerdinand: Ah, hmm... Maybe I should not have brought this up.\nBernadetta: Why not?! Carnivorous plants are adorable!\nFerdinand: Aha, yes. Adorable. Anyway, if I had actually known you, I would have accepted the proposal.\nBernadetta: Um... Why? Did you have some scheme in mind?!\nFerdinand: No. I just mean, now that I have gotten to know you, I would have been happy to...\nBernadetta: So you're saying you'd...with me? Heh heh... It's...getting kind of hot in here, isn't it? Maybe, um... Maybe it's the tea...\nFerdinand: Why are you getting so worked up? That was all a long time ago, now.\nBernadetta: Long time ago?\nFerdinand: Yes, Now we are soldiers fighting together in the same great conflict, right? And my parents are gone, so any agreements they might have cooked up would be completely invalid.\nBernadetta: I...guess so...\nFerdinand: Just think. If we had been married, we would not have been able to build such a deep friendship.\nBernadetta: That's true. Yeah, we never would have gotten this close! I would've given up on the relationship my parents chose for me and shut myself away even more.\nFerdinand: So, all in all, I am glad I refused to marry that doll-cursing princess.\nBernadetta: Hey! I said I never made curse dolls!\nFerdinand: Haha! Sorry, sorry. I am just glad to have met you at the monastery. I had better take my leave. We should have tea together again sometime soon!\n(Ferdinand leaves)\n\nBernadetta: Yeah. Um, see you. I'm...glad we met here too. ♪ Hm hm-hm... Hm hm-hm hmm... ♪_null_null_null_
6_28_Bernadetta: La la-la la-la laa... Such lovely weather for painting!\nLinhardt: Bernadetta?\nBernadetta: AH! Who are you?! Where did you come from?!\nLinhardt: It's just me, Linhardt. What are you doing?\nBernadetta: Painting! Just painting! Not important. Am I in your way? I'm in your way. I'll just go. I'm going.\nLinhardt: No need for all that. I just came out here to read. I'll stay quiet and still so as not to bother you. How's that? If you want to go, that's fine too.\nBernadetta: Um... No, I'll...stay.\nLinhardt: …\nBernadetta: Ugh...\nLinhardt: Say, aren't you usually holed up inside?\nBernadetta: Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry for coming here! I'm sorry for bothering you! You're mad, aren't you? You look really mad! I'll just pack up! I'll be gone before you know it!\nLinhardt: Mad? At you? Never. I rather admire you in fact. I fantasize about shutting myself in my room and never going outside again. it sounds like paradise. However, I wouldn't be able to perform my research. That, Bernadetta, is a problem.\nBernadetta: Wh-what? You admire me? Nu-uh. No way. I know a trick when I see one! What are you plotting? So you want to copy me, is that it? And what's a copy do with the original? Replace it! Well, I've got you figured out. I won't just sit back and take it... I'll fight you!\nLinhardt: What? That's n— Ugh, this is too much hassle, I'm leaving.\nBernadetta: Ah! I'm sorry! Please don't kill me!_Bernadetta: …\nLinhardt: …\nBernadetta: Hmm... A little more crimson, maybe?\nLinhardt: May I suggest vermilion instead?\nBernadetta: Vermilio — ah! I know. I see it. You don't have to say it. I've got no talent at all...\nLinhardt: I said nothing about your talent. I simply suggested vermilion over crimson. Do you know vermilion? It's just a softer shade of crimson. I believe it would... Oh, forget it. This is your artistic vision, and I am but a meddler. I am going to read my book and leave you to your art.\nBernadetta: Um... N-no, it's fine. Say what you want to say. It's...good advice. I'll use vermilion. Thank you.\nLinhardt: Well, I'd best be heading back.\nBernadetta: Phew. Finally done! I think.\nLinhardt: All finished?\nBernadetta: Uh, please, don't look at it!\nLinhardt: Everything looks a bit faded, doesn't it? Ironically, crimson may have been a better choice after all. The sense of distance on the petals is a little strange. Perhaps you should pay closer attention to such details as you paint. A preliminary sketch would do wonders. Still... Ah, forget my pedantic comments. You really do have potential.\nBernadetta: …\nLinhardt: Bernadetta?\nBernadetta: Ugh! Idiot! Hopeless! Waste of time! Just burn the whole thing, Bernie! Break your stupid brushes and never paint again!\nLinhardt: Huh. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself._Linhardt: I was under the impression you were going to break all of your paintbrushes.\nBernadetta: Cut it out, Linhardt!\nLinhardt: I'm just glad you're back to painting. I felt terrible about what happened last time, you know. I guess I should have kept my opinions about your painting to myself.\nBernadetta: Hm. Maybe you should have.\nLinhardt: …\nBernadetta: …\nLinhardt: So what do you suppose is the name for this kind of situation?\nBernadetta: Um, what situation? Am I in your way again? I must be. OK, let me pack my things and I'll be off.\nLinhardt: Ugh... No. that's not what I meant. I'm talking about when two people are together but not together. When they're basically by themselves.\nBernadetta: Um, I'm not sure what you mean. I'm always alone.\nLinhardt: Oh? Alone? Well, there it is then. I suppose you could say we're alone together. We're each here alone, yet together. So we're alone... together. What do you think?\nBernadetta: Alone...together? Oh... Wait. I get it. That's just a nice way of saying you want to be alone, right? Alone-alone. If that's what you mean, I'll go.\nLinhardt: Please, Bernadetta. You shouldn't go. Being alone together means accomplishing more. We each have the concentration one gets from time alone but also the thrill of being with someone else. I find it to be an exhilarating environment. Have you felt that as well?\nBernadetta: Huh? Me? Um, I'd rather be alone, but... When I'm painting and I know you can see, I worry about what you might point out about it. Is that the thrill you mean? Because I feel that.\nLinhardt: Here's what I wish to point out about your painting... You've really improved. Your lines are bolder, your color choices more informed, and your composition as a whole...\nBernadetta: Did you actually just praise me, Linhardt?~ Whats next, a rain of flying pigs?\nLinhardt: I was just... saying what I think. Look, you probably have talent, and you work hard too...\nBernadetta: Oh no. I'm on to you now. You're scheming, but you won't get anywhere by flattering me! Try all you want to get your hooks into my heart — you won't fool me!\nLinhardt: I'm not sure how praising you means I'm trying to get my hooks into your heart...\nBernadetta: I have a heart of stone! No one will ever get to it!\nLinhardt: What a shame. I suppose I'll stop praising you, then.\nBernadetta: Y-you will? No, I...I didn't mean it that way! You can, um... you can praise me as much as you want!\nLinhardt: I don't understand you one whit. However, if you want praise, then praise you will get. You're cute.\nBernadetta: Ah! Don't say stuff like that!_null_null_null_
6_7_Bernadetta: And that one goes there. Perfect!\nCaspar: Oh! Hey, Bernadetta! What's going on?\nBernadetta: Ah! Enemy! Enemy's here! We're under attack! Help! Someone! Anyone!\nCaspar: Help? I'm the one who came here for help. I guess I'll just take care of it myself. I can't believe I got hurt trying to break up someone else's fight. It's ridiculous! All I do is step in to calm them down, and the next thing you know they're both at my throat. Hey, you ever been in a fight?\nBernadetta: Fight? You're challenging me to a duel?! No, no-no-no-no! I can't! I've never fought anyone in all my life! I surrender! You win!\nCaspar: Uh, all right. That was easy enough. Not to be rude, but do you ever think that maybe your attitude makes you a little unapproachable? You should try stepping outside and socializing. I'm sure you'd make friends in no time if you didn't waste it all in here.\nBernadetta: Outside?! In no time?! Oh, sure! Yeah! Why didn't I think of that?! Or maybe it's just not as easy for me as it is for you! Did that ever cross your mind?!\nCaspar: Why wouldn't it be? Making friends is easy! This one time I even made friends with someone I'd just been in a fight with. I think it was the gorgeous view that did it. We really shared a moment... C'mon, let's go check it out!\n(Screen fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: Uh, h-hold on! Wh-what are you doing?! Please don't touch me! Aaah! Put me down! Put me down!\nCaspar: Calm down. I'm just gonna carry you outta here. Easy does it!\n(Screen fades back in)\n\nCaspar: And here we are! See? That wasn't so bad now, was it? And what about this view? Gorgeous, right?\nBernadetta: So this is what death is like. Didn't expect it to be so...sudden. Come and claim me, sweet death. But first, let this evening sun wash clean my imperfect soul...\nCaspar: Hey now, don't go dying on me, Bernadetta. It's just the sun.\nBernadetta: Huh? Wh-what? Where am I? Oh, it's...pretty. Such a lovely view..._Bernadetta: Um... Hi...\nCaspar: Well, well. If it isn't Bernadetta! What brings you here?\nBernadetta: Am I bothering you? I'm sorry! I didn't mean to! I'll come back another time!\nCaspar: Don't leave yet, you just got here. Was there something you wanted to talk about?\nBernadetta: Uh... Yes... Do you remember that time in town?\nCaspar: In town? Oh! You mean when all those thieves showed up. That was rough. I heard a bunch of people got robbed.\nBernadetta: N-no, not that! I mean the time I was...carried off.\nCaspar: Some thieves tried to carry you off?! Horrible! Absolutely horrible! Just tell me which way they went. I'm gonna—\nBernadetta: That's not what I mean! Oh, just forget it.\nBernadetta turns around to leave\n\nCaspar: Wait! Don't go! What are you trying to ask me?\nBernadetta: Will you really listen this time?!\nCaspar: Of course. Sorry. You have my full attention.\nBernadetta: Do you remember when you carried me to that spot with the really pretty view? Where is that place? I've been looking all over.\nCaspar: The place I took you with the view? Oh! Right! OK, first you go out the monastery and— Actually, it's kinda tricky to explain. C'mon, I'll take you there again. But pay attention this time.\n(Screen fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: Huh?! Wait— What are you— No! Not again! Aaah! Stop! Put me down!_Caspar: Come on, Bernadetta! Open up! Why are you so mad at me? I have no clue what this is about, but I'm sorry!\nBernadetta: You have no clue? Don't you remember what you did to me?!\nCaspar: Uhh, no? I didn't do anything!\nBernadetta: Yes you did! You did all kinds of things! But the worse one was carrying me off...twice! I thought I might die!\nCaspar: What are you even talking about?\nBernadetta: Don't act like you never took me to that place!\nCaspar: What place?! Why won't you— OH! The place with the pretty view! Why are you mad about that?\nBernadetta: Because you hauled me around like a piece of luggage!\nCaspar: Again, why are you mad about that?\nBernadetta: Don't act all surprised! How would you feel to be yanked around like that?!\nCaspar: I'm sorry. I didn't realize I... I was just excited to show it to you! Maybe I went a little overboard. I'm real sorry about all that...\nBernadetta: You are? Well, I hope you understand now.\nCaspar: I definitely do, and I feel awful about it. What can I do to make it up to you? Anything you want! I wanna show you how seriously sorry I am!\nBernadetta: Well, all right. I'd like you to, um, bring me to that place again. But promise me two things first.\nCaspar: Anything!\nBernadetta: No carrying. No pulling me around. Treat me gently.\nCaspar: Sure, sure, of course. No problem. But... that was three things, not two.\nBernadetta: That was one thing! Be gentle, OK?!\nCaspar: Ah! Oh, OK! Sorry, sorry! What's the other thing?\nBernadetta: Um, I want you to promise not to take anyone else there... Only me.\nCaspar: All right, I can promise that. Seems a little strange though... Why do you care—\nBernadetta: Come on! If you really want to apologize, hurry up and take me there!\nCaspar: Right! On it!\n(Screen briefly fades to black)\n\nCaspar: Here we are! Look at that gorgeous sunset!\nBernadetta: This is it... the same view. After all that time inside, the sun feels like it's piercing right through me.\nCaspar: Haha, this little bit of sunshine? You really gotta get outside more! From now on, I'm gonna take you to all sorts of different places! I promise I'll be gentle, and I promise I won't take anyone else. Just you and me, all right?\nBernadetta: What?! Um, but— OK. But if you get sick of me, I'm sorry ahead of time!\nCaspar: Haha, what? Good one, Bernadetta..._null_null_null_
6_14_Bernadetta: Ah, it's peaceful here. Flowers are so calming. Just looking at these, it's like all the terrible parts of the day just disappear. If only people could be more like flowers...\nDorothea: What's Bern doing? She looks like there's something wrong.\nBernadetta: All these nobles are just terrifying, and the commoners... Just look at Dorothea. So pretty, popular, dazzling... There's no way someone like me could ever be close with someone like that.\nDorothea: Bern, are you OK?\nBernadetta: Ah! Dorothea! Did you hear all that?\nDorothea: Just the part about you wishing you could get along with someone. So, Bern, who've you got a crush on? Seriously now, you have to tell me. Who are they? Do I know them? I'm so excited for you, Bern!\nBernadetta: Um, n-no. I was...actually thinking about...being friends with you.\nDorothea: Me? I thought we already were friends.\nBernadetta: That's n-not what I mean. Oh, I'm such a coward! I thought it would be great if we could be closer. But old memories just get in the way for me.\nDorothea: Bern, whatever happened in the past, you know you have my full support. I'm here for you. I thought we'd already been friends for a long time no. Please...\nBernadetta: Just forget it. We'll never be close friends. Father would just... He would just... Aaaah! Nooo!\nDorothea: Wait! I...Father? What did she mean by that?_Dorothea: Hello, Bern.\nBernadetta: Oh, no. What did I do this time? Did I offend you? Is this your revenge?\nDorothea: No, not at all. I just want to talk.\nBernadetta: If you promise not to resort to violence, I'll do whatever you want.\nDorothea: Bern, I've just been worried about you. That's all. When I said I was your friend, you ran away, saying something about your father. Remember?\nBernadetta: Um... Vaguely...\nDorothea: I know you've lived through some bad times. If you could tell me about it, maybe I could help?\nBernadetta: Oh, I don't know.\nDorothea: Please. Your father's not here now. Whatever it is, you're safe to tell me.\nBernadetta: All right...\n(Scene transition)\n\nBernadetta: My parents told me never to befriend a commoner. They said commoners are scum and that they'd crush any that tried to come near me.\nDorothea: Hang on. Scum? They called me—I mean commoners—they called us scum?\nBernadetta: Yeah. But once, a long time ago, I did secretly make friends with one...a boy. When my father found out about him, he disappeared the very next day. I heard he was found beaten half to death. I never saw him again. Since then, I've been terrified of making friends with anyone. Commoners, especially.\nDorothea: I... I never knew that kind of thing really happened. You hear stories, sure, but... Oh, Bern. I'm so sorry.\nBernadetta: …\nDorothea: I'm proud to be your commoner friend!\nBernadetta: Dorothea!\nDorothea: Hey now, relax. There's nothing to bawl about. If your dad tried to beat me up, I'd return the favor and then some.\nBernadetta: Return...the favor?\nDorothea: When I was in the opera, you better believe I had run-ins with the most wicked, terrible men. I survived kidnappings, attempted murders, all kinds of stuff. But you know what? I broke those guys' arms. Snap! It was a thank-you for all the trouble they went through trying to hurt me.\nBernadetta: You're incredible, Dorothea.\nDorothea: So now that you know I can defend myself, can we be friends, Bern?\nBernadetta: All right. Yeah. Yeah!_null_null_null_null_
6_34_Bernadetta: Petra's really nice. Never yells, never says mean things about people. Maybe she'd be my friend. Oh, there she is now. OK, Bernie, you can do this!\n(Scene transition)\n\nPetra: (facing away) Bernadetta, are you needing help with something?\nBernadetta: Ah! How did you know? Do you have eyes on the back of your head or something?!\n(Petra turns around)\n\nPetra: I...do not have that, no.\nBernadetta: Right... Um, can I ask you something? Do you want to, um...maybe, uh...be friends or something? Maybe? Maybe you don't. Maybe you don't like me. I don't know what you think of me.\nPetra: What I am thinking? I am thinking that you remind me of prey.\nBernadetta: Wh-what?\nPetra: Yes. Like a rabbit in the tall grass. Always watching for enemies, and you flee at any sign of danger. You are quick also. I must be careful that I am not hunting Bernie when I take out my bow.\nBernadetta: Oh, you...try not to shoot me. That's, um...nice.\nPetra: You have similarities with prey, that is all I mean to be saying.\nBernadetta: So you're saying you might end up hunting me?!\nPetra: There is no need to have concern. I will make sure my arrows are not hitting you.\nBernadetta: Th-that isn't comforting! Whatever I did to deserve this, forgive me!\n(Bernadetta runs away)\n\nPetra: You do not need forgiveness, but it is yours, if you are wanting it. Was I saying something wrong?_Bernadetta: Hunting? Really? There's no way I can do this. Goddess, why couldn't I have stayed in today...\nPetra: Bernadetta. Is this a trouble you are having? I heard that the duty to hunt is yours today.\nBernadetta: The duties all got assigned while I was holed up in my room...\nPetra: Do not be worrying. I can show you the way to hunt well.\nBernadetta: Oh, um... OK, then...\n(Scene transition)\n\nPetra: When you see a beast, you are thinking of it as an enemy. That is how prey thinks. You must think of the beast as food. That is how the hunter thinks.\nBernadetta: So it's not an enemy. It's food. But, um, how is it food when it's still alive?\nPetra: You pick the vegetables from the field. Those have life too. It is the same. You take a blade in your hand and take the lives of the vegetable. You cut their stalks and harvest without mercy. They do not scream, but you are still their killer.\nBernadetta: K-killer?!\nPetra: Fruit ripens and falls to the ground. The seeds sprout and a new life is born. That is life's cycle. It has cruelty, yes. But you must end life to eat. You must be killing to be living.\nBernadetta: Maybe, but I don't know if I want to be some...some kind of vegetable murderer!\nPetra: It is the same for rabbits, deer, pheasants. The only difference being that they cannot cry out. You must do what you must do to be living in this world. It is your task.\nBernadetta: A task. Yes, just a task. A completely mindless task.\nPetra: Feel it. There, in the grass. Prey is moving. Just like a vegetable in the wind. Give it an arrow, just like you would give a vegetable a blade. It is just your task.\nBernadetta: Uh, right. That makes sense. It's just like cutting a stem.\nPetra: You are now a hunter. You have learned how to hunt.\nBernadetta: I am? I have? Oh, good! What a relief.\nPetra: You have understanding now, I can tell.\nBernadetta: Great! Leave it to me. I'll hunt down my prey just like they're vegetables.\nPetra: I have belief in you.\nBernadetta: Aw, thanks, Petra! I can do this! Make way for Huntmaster Bernie!\nPetra: Have luck, Bernie.\n(screen fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: Ugh! Ow! Wh-what? No! Stay back! I'm sorry, Mr. Rabbit! I didn't mean it!

Unless I'm offending you just by standing here?!\nFelix: No. Here. I believe this is yours.\nBernadetta: Huh? Oh. Yeah, that's my satchel. Wait, wh-where did you get that?!\nFelix: Stop asking questions and just take it.\nBernadetta: No! Trap! It's a trap!\nFelix: Why are you acting like this?\nBernadetta: Acting?! Does this terror on my face look fake to you?!\nFelix: You're being difficult. Come on, this is yours.\nBernadetta: I can't! Your icy glare has frozen me completely!\nFelix: Shut up! Just take the thing.\nBernadetta: No! P-please don't kill me!\nFelix: What? Who's going to—\nBernadetta: Sword! He's got a sword! Aaaah!\n(screen briefly fades to black)\n\nFelix: My sword! how did you—\nBernadetta: I can't do this anymore!\n(Bernadetta leaves)\n\nFelix: What an odd girl. But she's certainly caught my attention. I've never seen that technique before. Oh. I still have to give this back to her._Felix: You.\nBernadetta: Ah! What'd I do?! Am I in your way? I'm in your way. I know. I get it. I'm sorry. I can't stand the sight of me either!\nFelix: I never said that. Stay right there. You're always running away. You must really find me irritating.\nBernadetta: Irritating, I know! I completely— What? No, I mean, I know I'm irritating, but—Huh?\nFelix: Stop. Do you remember when you came up behind me and knocked the sword from my hands? I need you to teach me that technique.\nBernadetta: Sword? Teach? Technique?! That's, um, that's a joke, right? Because that's...that's just about the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.\nFelix: Maybe so. But I saw you do it. You don't remember? You moved like a flash, and before I knew it—\nBernadetta: Nope! Wasn't Bernie. You must have dreamed it. Unless my accuser dares to produce some evidence.\nFelix: Yes, evidence. I still have your satchel. See?\nBernadetta: Oh, my satchel. W-wait, that? No, that's, um... That's not mine. You can't prove it's mine!\nFelix: You know it's yours.\nBernadetta: I'm innocent—I swear! Merciful Seiros, save me!\nFelix: This is getting nowhere. But, hmm... Maybe I should corner her like last time. Then she'll use the technique without thinking.\nBernadetta: Aaaah!\nFelix: …\nFelix: Never mind. I'm done here.\nBernadetta: Lies! All lies! I didn't do any—Huh? Wh-where'd he go?_Felix: That's Bernadetta. Those thugs are pursuing her. What did the weakling expect, running ahead? I can't leave her alone for one second...\nRogue: You really ran us around, little lady. Nowhere to run now, though.\nBernadetta: Ah! It's all over! I'm done for!\nRogue: Wha—My sword!\nFelix: Ah! The technique! No. I can't stand by and watch. You're not hurt are you?\nBernadetta: Felix? Is that really you? Thank you so much! I was sure I was finished. You saved my life! I can never repay—Huh?\nFelix: Shut your mouth and calm down. I should be thanking you.\nBernadetta: Um... What?\nFelix: When you were surrounded, I got to see you use your technique again. I get it now. For just a moment, you flail your limbs like a wild creature. If I could learn to do that, I'd be unstoppable.\nBernadetta: Uh, in that case, I'm...happy to help?\nFelix: I would be even more impressed if you hadn't been screaming the whole time.\nBernadetta: Hey, come on! I was running for my life! Don't make fun of me for—Huh? No way...\nBernadetta: …\nFelix: Why are you staring at me?\nBernadetta: You're actually smiling! Not like a sarcastic smirk either—a big goofy grin from ear to ear! You're just a big old nut, aren't you Felix? Once you get through the shell, there's all sorts of good stuff inside.\nFelix: You don't know me.\nBernadetta: Aww, there's that shell again.\nFelix: OK, that's it! Quit making fun of me!\nBernadetta: Ah! I didn't mean anything by it! I'm sorry!_Bernadetta: Hey Felix! Can I talk to you for a minute?\nFelix: What is it? I'm listening.\n(scene transition)\n\nBernadetta: Look, over there! Isn't that a cute kitty?!\nFelix: Oh, I agree. I don't dislike cats.\n(scene transition)\n\nBernadetta: Here, try this. It's candy, but I promise it isn't sweet.\nFelix: No, thank you. Sweet or not, I don't eat candy.\n(scene transition)\n\nBernadetta: Hey, are you busy? I've got this great book, and...\nFelix: What are you doing?\nBernadetta: Huh?\nFelix: Why are you so concerned with me? More importantly, didn't you used to be shy?\nBernadetta: Oh, I'm shy as ever.\nFelix: Then why are you following me around?\nBernadetta: That's, um... Well, you know how ghosts are only scary because you can't see or talk to them?\nFelix: You're saying I'm a ghost.\nBernadetta: What?! No! It was, uh, just a metaphor!\nFelix: Heh. There you are, foolish as ever.\nBernadetta: That's it! You're smiling again!\nFelix: What?\nBernadetta: That's why I've been working so hard to talk to you. I wanted to see you smile again.\nFelix: Heh. I'm disappointed. Such a trivial reason. You're pestering me without a hint of fear, just to see me smile. You've really grown up.\nBernadetta: Um... Yeah, I guess. Wait, why are you being nice? Did something terrible happen?! Did you have a falling-out with an old friend or something?!\nFelix: …\nBernadetta: This is the part where you angry at me, isn't it?\nFelix: Uh... Come on. You were saying something about a book I should read?\nBernadetta: Really?! Well, um... It's, um... This one! If you wouldn't mind...,_A+_null_

Celebrating something?\nBernadetta: What? N-no! Nothing at all!\nSylvain: Hey, relax! It's OK if you'd rather not tell me. By the way, I believe you left something in the library... A half-written manuscript? Your own work, I presume? I was curious who it belonged to and gave it a read-through. You're a really talented writer!\nBernadetta: …\nSylvain: I'm sorry. I peeked at the first page then the next, and I couldn't stop. I think it's good enough to publish. It's the kind of adventure story that will make people laugh and cry! I love how you never know what mess the hero is going to get herself into next. I'm dying to read more!\nBernadetta: …\nSylvain: Uh, your mouth's hanging wide open. Bernadetta? Are you OK?\nBernadetta: Sorry, um... Was someone talking about a story?\nSylvain: Yes? That would be me. I read your book.\nBernadetta: Y-y-you read my book?\nSylvain: Yeah, and I loved it!\nBernadetta: Aaah! I'm so humiliated! Please, forget everything you read!\n(Bernadetta runs off screen)\n\nSylvain: Humiliated? No, I think the word you're looking for is \"humbled\" because — and she's gone. Now what do I do with this book?\n(Screen fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: Ugh, he actually read it! I regret everything... Even if I burn the pages, I can't burn his memory. Not unless I... throw him in the fire too... No, that's awful. Don't think things like that, Bernie._Bernadetta: Ugh... I've looked everywhere... I guess Sylvain must still have it... Huh? When did this book get here? Wait. This is mine! And there's... something sticking out of it... A letter?\n\"Dear Author, I read your manuscript quite by accident and duly apologize. However, I also write today to inform you that I enjoyed your story tremendously. I laughed and cried as the heroine overcame her many obstacles, growing stronger with each step. You literary style presents a unique perspective. I could sense you watching over the protagonist.\"\nBernadetta: Heh-heh! Wow, so many compliments, and so much attention to detail.\n\"The girl's failures are as compelling as her triumphs. Since authors are told to write what they know... I believe your tale would not have been so convincing were it not for your own experiences.\"\nBernadetta: Um, what? My own experiences? That's a weird way to give praise... Who wrote this anyways? Who would read my story so carefully and then write this long letter to tell me about it? Whoever it is, they must be wonderful. Someone like my dear old uncle...\n\"I do hope my letter inspires you to keep writing. Looking forward to the next chapter. Your devoted fan, Sylvain.\"\nBernadetta: What?! Sylvain?! It can't be!\nSylvain: Heya, Bernadetta. Did you read my letter?\nBernadetta: Ah! How long have you been standing there?!\nSylvain: I'm sorry, but I fell head over heels for your story. It's so good, and I just had to tell you about it. So what do you say? Will you write more? Why don't we talk literature over some tea?\nBernadetta: Oh, I see your plan now! You're out to humiliate me! Very clever, but I'm not falling for it!_null_null_null_null_
6_25_Ingrid: Bernadetta, please come out of your room. You've been in there for ages. You need to train.\nBernadetta: Um... no. Sorry, not happening.\nIngrid:\n(Part I): I'm not playing around, Bernadetta. This training is absolutely crucial to your future.\n(Part II): I'm not playing around, Bernadetta. This training is absolutely crucial to the war.\nBernadetta: I don't care. I can't handle it today. Please leave.\nIngrid: Why did you come here?\nBernadetta:\n(Part I): Why did I come here? I didn't choose to join the academy. I was forced.\n(Part II): Why did I come here? I didn't choose to join the academy. I was forced. Then more stuff happened, and I didn't have a say in any of it. So here I am... somehow.\nIngrid: I suppose not everyone has to be pleased about being here, but even so... Bernadetta, I'll ask one more time—please come out of there.\nBernadetta: And I'll tell you one more time. It's not happening. Not right now. Not today.\nIngrid: You leave me no alternative. If you're near the door, you'd better step away. Aaaagh!\n(Screen briefly fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: Ah! My door! Why?!\nIngrid: Now hurry along, Bernadetta. You've got lots of training to catch up on.\nBernadetta: Spare me! I'll train! I'll train! Just... not with you. Anyone but you, please!\nIngrid: Is that so? That presents a problem. I know we are two very different people. But whether or not you like me, we are on the same side and must learn to work together.\nBernadetta: It's n-not about any of that! If this is how you treat people on your own side, wh-what do you do to your enemies?\nIngrid: Don't ask questions you don't want answers to. I did what was necessary to get you to comply. Nothing more. I do hope that the professor will be able to help you through the rest of your training. In the meantime, I will fix your door. Good luck.\nBernadetta: Um, uh... Right. OK. Good._Ingrid: Ah, there you are. I just checked your room, but obviously you weren't in there.\nBernadetta: Oh! You, um... You didn't break the door down again looking for me, did you?\nIngrid: Of course not. I'm not unreasonable. I just wanted to discuss something with you.\nBernadetta: Discuss? Is that... really all? OK. I can handle that.\nIngrid: Firstly, I'd like to apologize... for breaking down your door. I'm sorry. It was perhaps a bit rash. There was a period of time, quite a while ago, when I acted much the same as you. I spent many hours locked away in my own room.\nBernadetta: You did? R-really?\nIngrid:\n(Part I): Really. Because I understood where you were coming from, I knew I had to intervene. Whether you're hiding under your pillows or not, trouble will come our way, sooner or later. At that time, is it better to have wasted your energy hiding away? Or better to have spent it honing your skills, so that you can lend a hand?\n(Part II): Really. Because I understood where you were coming from, I knew I had to intervene. At a moment's notice, all you care for could be swept away. At that time, is it better to have wasted your energy hiding away? Or better to have spent it honing your skills, so that you can lend a hand?\nBernadetta: But even if I did train, what's the point? It's not like it would do much good.\nIngrid: Don't speak so disparagingly of yourself. It doesn't help things. You have plenty of strengths.\nBernadetta: No, um... You think so?\nIngrid: Just look at how quickly you sprint back to your room, for example. With more practice, I have a feeling you could outrun most anyone. You're also exceedingly talented in the arts. Surely there's a creative way to apply those talents on the battlefield. Stop wasting your breath and energy on putting yourself down. Just try your best. I'm not giving up on you. You have so much power in you, just waiting to be unleashed.\nBernadetta: You really believe all that? That's so nice. All right. For you, Ingrid, I'll do it.\nIngrid: Excellent. Let's be on our way.\n(Screen fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: H-hey, w-wait! Aaaah! What are you doing?! I didn't agree to this! Put me down! Oof! Ugh!

Good thing I found such an out-of-the-way spot to play. Only the pretty flowers heard me here. Isn't that right, little flower? You're the only one who heard, aren't you?

I'm no flower.\n(Bernadetta turns around)\n\nBernadetta: Oh no. Raphael, you heard it all, didn't you?\nRaphael: I did! What kind of instrument was that? I could hear it all the way over at the training grounds. It was great. I didn't know you could play!\nBernadetta: All the way from the training grounds?! Ugh!\nRaphael: That's right. Then I came here to tell you how good you sounded!\nBernadetta: Good? No. No, I'm on to you. First you flatter me, then you get me to perform on stage in front of everyone to humiliate me!\nRaphael: Uhhh...no? But that's a great idea. Everyone should be able to hear your music!\nBernadetta: Ah! I knew it! Monster! I won't fall victim to your schemes!\n(Bernadetta runs off.)\n\nRaphael: I don't know what just happened, but I think I might have scared her..._Bernadetta: ♪ Hm hm-hm hm-hm... ♪\nRaphael: …\nBernadetta: ♪ Hm hm-hm-hm...

Please, c-calm down!\nBernadetta: Calm down?! Sure, why shouldn't I? Nothing's more relaxing than being spied on! I just love it wh-when huge scary men lurk behind me with their insidious smiles and heinous schemes! Ugh! You just want to make me a laughing stock—ruin me in front of everyone. I know it!\nRaphael: Please! Listen! I only came to hear you play. That's it. Promise. I'm not gonna make you perform in front of everyone else. I just wanted to hear you myself.\nBernadetta: J-just you? Nobody else? Really?\nRaphael: Really. I kept trying to ask, but you always ran away.\nBernadetta: That doesn't mean you can just watch me creepily from the shadows, you know. That would scare anyone.\nRaphael: You're right. I'm sorry. I just didn't know how else to get your attention. You get so scared. But it looks like I ended up scaring you anyway. I'll leave you alone, Bernadetta... I really just wish I could have heard you play.\n(Raphael walks away)\n\nBernadetta: Raphael?_Bernadetta: There he is. OK, Bernie, you can do this.\nRaphael: Oh! Bernadetta! Sorry, just passing through. Didn't mean to scare you again...\nBernadetta: No-no, it's all right. Actually, I came to talk to you. I owe you an apology. It's, um, long overdue.\nRaphael: Huh? What do you have to apologize for?\nBernadetta: I'm hopelessly terrified of you, so every time I see you, I kind of lose my mind. But once you're gone and I get time to calm down, I realize I'm making a big deal out of nothing. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before. I feel awful! I hope you can forgive me!\nRaphael: Come on, now. It's all right. I wasn't really that bothered by it. Promise. I shoulda been more careful not to scare you. I'm a big guy, and my muscles can be intimidating.\nBernadetta: No! No, you did nothing wrong! It's all my fault.\nRaphael: How about this? Let's say it's both our fault and call it even. But you know, I've been thinking... You really are scared of everything. Is there something we can do to fix that?\nBernadetta: You mean like a cure?\nRaphael: Something like that. I think we can figure this out. Your biggest fear is talking to people, right? If that's the case, you need to change the way you think about talking! Right now you think it's bad so you're afraid to do it. I figure if you talk to more people, then you'll think talking is good! It might be hard to suddenly start talking to people though... You're gonna need to take it slow. Oh! I know! Start with me!\nBernadetta: W-with you? That'll be, um...tough. Maybe, um... Maybe if you turn around? Face the other way?\nRaphael: I guess...if that's what you need. (He turns around.) How's this?\nRaphael: I bet if you get used to talking to me, your fears will go away in no time!\nBernadetta: You're, ah, still really intimidating. But OK, I'll give it a try..._Bernadetta: Hi, Raphael! Lovely weather today, isn't it?\nRaphael: Sure is! Staring up at the sky on a clear day always reminds me of my hometown.\nBernadetta: What was it like there?\nRaphael: Hmm...let's see... Well, it's a real calm and peaceful place. Big, clear skies too, just like this. It's full of friendly people and delicious food. Talking about it makes me want to go back.\nBernadetta: Yeah... It's a shame we're stuck fighting in this war.\nRaphael: Right? I wonder what my little sis is up to. She's probably grown so much by now... I haven't seen her since I came back to Garreg Mach. She probably wouldn't even recognize me anymore.\nBernadetta: I'll bet she would! How could she possibly forget such a terrifying— Um... Such a terrific big brother? There's no way!\nRaphael: You really think so? That's a relief. All this relief's making me hungry! Want to head to the dining hall?\nBernadetta: Oh! Um... Actually, we can eat here. I cooked something up for us today.\nRaphael: Oh yeah? I won't say no to that!\n(screen briefly fades to black)\n\nBernadetta: I heard you really like meat, so, um—here you go! It's my first time cooking something like this. I can at least guarantee it isn't poisoned.\nRaphael: Meat? That's my favorite! I'd probably eat it even if it was poisoned! Om mmm mmm... Mmm? Mmm mmm...\nBernadetta: Is it, uh...good?\nRaphael: Graaah! That was amazing!\nBernadetta: Really? You like it?\nRaphael: So tender! So juicy! So full of flavor! It was practically falling off the bone! The flavor was so rich and sweet! I— Wait...how can meat be sweet?\nBernadetta: Is sweet bad? I thought it was pretty tasty, myself.\nRaphael: No, no, no! It was delicious! I couldn't believe it! I'd eat more fruits and vegetables if they were this good! If all food tasted like this I...I just don't know what I'd do with myself!\nBernadetta: Well, if you like it, I wouldn't mind, um, making more. Whenever you want, really!\nRaphael: Really?!

When I saw what you were doing, I thought, \"What the heck is that?\" But it turned out to be a nice touch, once I was actually wearing it. Practical too. When you're embroidering, you patch up the torn parts with new cloth, right? And that strengthens it, so the same part won't break so easily next time.\nBernadetta: Uh, I'm glad you liked it. At first, I felt like you thought it was stupid. I was worried you secretly hated me or something. It made me pretty scared to show you my stitching.\nLeonie: Haha, sorry.

6_37_Seteth: Hmm...\nBernadetta: ♪ Hm hm-hm-hmm… ♪ Oh, is that Seteth? Wow... He looks really deep in thought. I wonder what he's writing... A secret diary, maybe?\nSeteth: That phrase doesn't quite work, does it? Let's see about an alternative...\nBernadetta: Hmm, too uncertain for a diary. Maybe it's a letter... or a poem!\nSeteth: No, that's bound to introduce misunderstanding. Precision is the key.\nBernadetta: It must be really important if he's putting that much thought into every word.\nSeteth: But I mustn't over-complicate things either. Parting words ought to be precise.\nBernadetta: Parting? It's a farewell letter? Huh! Is he writing his resignation? Seteth can be a little scary sometimes, but I hope he doesn't leave. It'd be sad to see him go. He shouldn't make such rash decisions. If he's unhappy about something, he should tell someone!\nSeteth: Come now. Do you really think I would resign?\nBernadetta: Ah! You...you heard all that?!\nSeteth: If you don't wish to be heard talking to yourself, then you should not speak so loudly. I'm sorry to hear that you find me intimidating.\nBernadetta: Uh, I just... Ah, I'm sorry! I won't disturb you ever again!\nSeteth: Wait. Bernadetta! Ah, typical behavior for the girl. Most concerning. Can she really go through life this way?_Bernadetta: Here's your book of fables you lent me, Seteth. It was so interesting to learn all about Saint Indech that I read it cover to cover in one sitting!\nSeteth: Impressive. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Hm, what's this sticking out between the pages? Is this an illustration?\nBernadetta: No, nothing like that! I must have stuck it in there and forgotten... Just, um—give it back, please!\nSeteth: Are you certain this was accidental? It quite fits the descriptions in this chapter. Ah, I see. You included an illustration where you thought the visual would be helpful.\nBernadetta: No-no-no-no, not at all! I was just fooling around... I have an overactive imagination, and I forgot to take it out before I gave you the book back.\nSeteth: It really is a lovely drawing, you know. Now that I've seen it, the book would feel incomplete without it. But who is this man next to Saint Indech? I can't help but notice he bears a resemblance to me.\nBernadetta: Oh, um, that's Saint Cichol. The book describes him as one of Saint Indech's closest friends. I got the feeling he was a very serious man but also really kind. You know, like you. So that probably explains the, um, resemblance.\nSeteth: I have to say, I never would have expected to be a reference model for Saint Cichol. What a curious ambivalence...\nBernadetta: Wh-what about furious violence?!\nSeteth: No, what I meant to say is that I am both flattered and a little embarrassed to be portrayed in this way. Perhaps it is because, in my study of him, I feel like I've also become a friend to Saint Indech. Records show that Saint Indech and Saint Cichol worked together to achieve great things. If possible, I would like it if the two of us could similarly combine our efforts.\nBernadetta: Wh-what? How do we figure into this?\nSeteth: We each bear their respective Crests, do we not? One might also say that, just as I am this book's author, you are now its illustrator. So, why don't you do some more illustrations? And color them as well. We'll add them to the book.\nBernadetta: You really want me to? I don't know if I'm good enough for something like that!_Seteth: Ah, Bernadetta. Have you finished your illustrations?\nBernadetta: Yes, I have! Finally. This is the first time I've ever made anything for a real live book. I was up all night finishing these! Bernie's all \"Berned\" out now. I guess if they're no good, we'll just have to \"Bern\" 'em all, eh? Heh-heh!\nSeteth: Let's...leave the topic of burning aside for now, shall we? Show me what you've done.\nBernadetta: So, um... Wh-what do you think?\nSeteth: This is excellent work. The color, especially. It truly brings your art to life. I will see that the new edition of our book is added to the Garreg Mach collection.\nBernadetta: Really? Oh, that's such a relief! It was a tough job, but—yeah! There's nothing Bernie can't handle!\nSeteth: You certainly do have some impressive mood swings. Actually, there is one thing I'd like to discuss.\nBernadetta: Oh no... What did I get wrong?!\nSeteth: Relax. I simply wanted to ask you about this last image. This is you, here, is it not?\nBernadetta: Um, yes. Is that wrong? What's wrong with it?\nSeteth: Nothing at all. I'm only curious. Does that make me the person standing beside you?\nBernadetta: Oh. Um, no. That's Saint Cichol.\nSeteth: Is that so? Then I must ask—what relationship are you suggesting you have with him?\nBernadetta: Well, I got the impression that the story of Saint Indech was told from Saint Cichol's point of view. So I just imagined that I asked Saint Cichol about it, and, um, that's where the picture came from. I guess I overdid it, huh? That's weird, isn't it? It's really weird. We can scrap it. Let's just get rid of it.\nSeteth: Ah, so that's why! Hahaha! That's amusing!\nBernadetta: Um... It is?\nSeteth: Very much. And I think this is a very fitting end to the book, actually. Saint Cichol and Bernadetta. They would have made quite an interesting pair, I think. In fact, if the two of you had lived in the same time, I am certain you would share a deep bond.\nBernadetta: What?! Saint Cichol and me? N-no way! I've already got my hands full just trying to be friends with you! But I've managed that at least, right? Haven't I?\nSeteth: Haha! Absolutely._Bernadetta: Um, excuse me.\nSeteth: Yes? What is it?\nBernadetta: I'm really sorry about what I said. I shouldn't have called you scary. Even if, um... you are. Ah, I said it again! I'm sorry!\nSeteth: It is nothing I haven't heard before. I am well aware of my austere nature, and I am accustomed to the commentary it brings. I do confess, however, that I was slightly hurt to see you flee from me in such abject terror.\nBernadetta: Don't be sad! I'll never do it again. I promise. But, um, I've been wondering... Were you really writing a farewell letter?\nSeteth: Ah—that. No, actually. I was composing a fable centered around Saint Indech.\nBernadetta: I didn't know you wrote fables. Wh-what's it about?\nSeteth: Saint Indech, one of the Four Saints. He was an extraordinarily shy person. It is said that he spent most of his life in solitude, unable to open his heart to anyone.\nBernadetta: I like him already.\nSeteth: He was, after all, a man who hid himself away at the bottom of a lake.\nBernadetta: Um... What's that about a lake?\nSeteth: Hm? Nothing. Now, something else to know about Saint Indech is that he had incredible skill with his hands. And that skill made him beloved by the people, because he constantly applied it to their benefit. The moral of the story is that shortcomings can be made up for with talent and kindness.\nBernadetta: I like it...but I don't have any talents like that. I can't even imagine being that helpful to people. Saint Indech must have been really gifted.\nSeteth: Don't be so quick to dismiss your abilities. You and he are actually alike in more ways than one. You possess Indech's Crest, after all, do you not?\nBernadetta: Um. Yes, I do. You really think we're alike? Now I want to know all about him! Do you think I could read your fable when it's done?\nSeteth: Absolutely. Indech's...example is something that we can all learn from.\nBernadetta: Thanks so much! I'm excited to see it!_C+_null_

Yeh... Yeh... Yooo...\nJeritza: Jeritza.\nBernadetta: Uh, yeah! That's it. Professor Jeritza!\nJeritza: I'm not a professor.\nBernadetta: Wait, what? You're not Professor Jeritza?! Oh, yeah! Professor Jeritza's always a mask. So then... Uh... Who are you?\nJeritza: Jeritza.\nBernadetta: Uh... I don't understand. Look... Are you Professor Jeritza, or aren't you? Please, make yourself clear!\nJeritza: I am Jeritza, but I am not a professor.\nBernadetta: A Jeritza who is not a professor... So there are two Jeritzas running around the Monastery?\nJeritza: ...\nBernadetta: Oh, wait... Ah! Aha! I got it. I get it now! You're no longer a professor, therefore you're just Jeritza. Plain old Jeritza. Our professor isn't a professor anymore, either, but doesn't mind the title. I guess I figured you'd be fine with being called professor as well.\nJeritza: When I was teaching, it was a simply a task. Nothing more.\nBernadetta: I don't really get it, but it sounds like there's a lot going on in that skull of yours, Jeritza. Oh, Bernie, what the heck are you even doing in the infirmary?\nJeritza: You took one look at me and passed out.\nBernadetta: Huh? Don't be silly. There's absolutely no reason I'd faint at the sight of you, Jeritz-\nJeritza: ...\nBernadetta: I... Uh... Uh! I'm coming down with a sudden cold, I think. Yeah. I've...uh...gotta run to my room!_Bernadetta: Jeritza?\nJeritza: What.\nBernadetta: Heh heh, I've got it all figured out.\nJeritza: Hm?\nBernadetta: Your true identity!\nJeritza: Hmm...\nBernadetta: If my detective skills are correct, then you...are... The Death Knight! ...Right?!\nJeritza: Everyone already knows that.\nBernadetta: Huh? What? Everyone knows? But...how?! Ugh, and here I thought that I had uncovered your big, spooky secret. Oh, Bernie...you're such a shut-in that you missed the biggest news in town...\nJeritza: ...\nBernadetta: So here's the deal, Jeritza. You've gotta tell me a secret about you that nobody else knows.\nJeritza: Why?\nBernadetta: Because! I sleuthed for hours upon hours! That's gotta be rewarded!\nJeritza: Just stop.\nBernadetta: Aw, come on. Please? Oh, oh! I know! I've got it! Why do you wear that crazy-looking armor when you're pretending to be the Death Knight? Are you just into the look of it? You like spooky stuff?\nJeritza: Well... I may have been drawn to that aspect. To look sinister. To embody death.\nBernadetta: Oh, I see! I thought, maybe you put on that mask and armor because, just like ol' Bernie, you don't like talking to people.\nJeritza: ...\nBernadetta: Heh heh...\nJeritza: There may be some truth to that. Talking to people is intolerable.\nBernadetta: Oh yeah?! I think I'm sensing a real kinship between us! So with that whole spooky getup on, it allowed you to speak to people with confidence!\nJeritza: No...\nBernadetta: Oh, hey, Jeritza? Don't tell anyone about this, OK? This is our little secret!\nJeritza: I don't mind, but... I also don't understand._Jeritza: Lately, I've noticed that our lunch times seem to coincide with one another's, and I-\nBernadetta: Oh no! Am I bothering you? I am, aren't I? I knew you were getting too carried away, Bernie! I mean, it's no wonder you don't wanna have lunch with me anymore. Just having me around probably makes your food taste awful...\nJeritza: My food tastes the same as it always does. I was merely stating a fact about our lunches coinciding.\nBernadetta: Oh...\nJeritza: But I am curious as to why you want to eat with me. It isn't that you-\nBernadetta: Aaah! Please forgive me! I am so sorry I've been using you to avoid people! The truth is hardly anyone ever comes near us, and it's been such a relief!\nJeritza: That's it? Well, then. I don't mind.\nBernadetta: Huh? You...don't?\nJeritza: When last we spoke, you mentioned feeling a kinship to me... So I wondered if you were thinking that we may be...kindred spirits, of a sort.\nBernadetta: Oh? Uh... Hmm... I... I mean, of course not, Jeritza! I didn't mean anything like that at all! Ha! Kindred spirits?! Us?! Ha...ha... Ha... But I mean... Totally hypothetical here, but, uh... If I did think we were kindred spirits, would...uh...there be a problem with that?\nJeritza: Yes. There would. The reason I dislike people...is because if I don't keep my distance, it is only a matter of time before I kill them. If you continue spending time near me, death may find its way to you.\nBernadetta: Uh... Oooh. I see. I, uh... I'm not quite sure how to say this, but...I'm willing to take the risk. I mean, we're in the middle of a war! I could die at any point now, even tomorrow! So if being near you means feeling comfortable during my final hours, well, that sounds like a pretty good deal to me!\nJeritza: ...\nBernadetta: I...wasn't entirely being honest with you just now, about the whole kindred spirits thingy... Want the real truth? I actually think we are. You and I have a whole lore in common. We both had a dark, troubling past. We both build walls around ourselves in response to that, to keep people out. Me, I take all my past hurts out on myself, but you... Jeritza, you take yours out on the world. Maybe that's why you harm people.\nJeritza: Hmm...\nBernadetta: Uh. Uh! Ah! That was really overstepping, wasn't it? I'm sorry!\nJeritza: ..._null_null_null_
6_40_Bernadetta: ♪ Hm hmm hm-hmm... Hm hmm hm-hmm... ♪ Huh?! Is that Yuri? I gotta evaporate! Maybe if I curl into a ball, I'll pass as a boulder. Or a... pebble.\nYuri: Hey, Bernadetta!\nBernadetta: Ah! You can see me?!\nYuri: Clearly... You're a tricky one. Always trying to hide when I'm around.\nBernadetta: S-sorry! Please forgive me!\nYuri: If you want forgiveness, then explain yourself. But make it quick. You always ramble on.\nBernadetta: Um! Well, when I was little, my mother and father, they-\nYuri: You've gotta be kidding. Cut to the chase, please.\nBernadetta: Uh... You remind me of one of my old friends.\nYuri: Oh come now. Whoever this friend of yours is can't possibly compare to me.\nBernadetta: I'm telling the truth!\nYuri: All right, all right. What was this friend like, then? The way you run and hide from me, they must've been a real piece of work.\nBernadetta: That's not it at all. He was the assistant to the gardener at our estate. My friend was gentle, trustworthy... gorgeous. And... well, he was the only person who was ever nice to me. We used to run around the gardens playing together.\nYuri: And why is it you keep running away from me?\nBernadetta: That's... Uh... Do I really have to say? We hardly even know each other!\nYuri: You never have to do anything. But if you don't, you and I won't have a shot at knowing one another, and you'll carry on avoiding me forever.\nBernadetta: But that's no good either! OK! OK! I'll tell you! The thing is, because of me, he got in trouble. After that, I never saw him again. You see, my father hated commoners, and when he found out I was spending a lot of time with one... Well... He's probably dead now! And it's all my fault! It's 'cause of me! He must've hated me!\nYuri: That... Ugh. That doesn't sound right to me. Why would you think all that? Nothing you did would make his death your fault. And hating you for something that isn't your fault is absolutely absurd - delusional, even.\nBernadetta: You're wrong! He'd definitely hate me if he knew! How would you know, anyway? What, did you know my friend or something?\nYuri: In a manner... Right. So, remember back when you were a kid? You tripped while holding some gardening shears. And your friend got cut pretty badly.\nBernadetta: Hmmm... Oh yeah! I remember... But... how did you know about that?\nYuri: If I bore you any ill will, it would have been for cutting my face with those damn shears.\nBernadetta: Cutting your face... Shears... But! There's no way!\nYuri: But there is. That friend? That was me, Bernadetta. Anyway, I'm glad I finally got to hear how you felt about all of that. Let's spend time together and chat about the good ol' days. Get to know each other again.\nYuri leaves\n\nBernadetta: But how did... But he! But!_Yuri: ... Bernadetta, knock it off. How long are you gonna keep this up.\nBernadetta: I can't have him find me. Time for a tactical withdrawal!\nYuri: Wait up, would you? Running away every time you see me is just going to wear both of us out. If you've got something to say, say it already. You've been shadowing me for ages. Think how I feel. You don't even show up for the war council when I'm there. Do you even know what's going on in the world?\nBernadetta: I know, but I... I... I just can't, OK?! I can't be around you, Yuri. It's just not doable! I know what my father did to you. It's all just too overwhelming! I thought you died...\nBernadetta turns away from Yuri\n\nYuri: You thought I had. But I hadn't. I was halfway to my grave, but I survived.\nBernadetta: Half... way?! Then that means the half of you that survived is gonna seek revenge on me!\nYuri: I was half dead, sure, but that really meant I was able to get out with my life. If I was to seek revenge, it would be on the count - not you. When I'm looking to make things even, it's all or nothing. You wouldn't be standing here talking to me right now if I'd targeted you.\nBernadetta turns back to Yuri\n\nBernadetta: If not here, then where would I be?! At the bottom of a ravine?!\nYuri: I wouldn't push you off a cliffside.\nBernadetta: Maybe you'll tie me to a big rock and drop me in the ocean! Is that it?! You're going to turn me into fish food! I knew it!\nYuri: What are you going on about?\nBernadetta runs away\n\nBernadetta: Mercy! If it has to be a watery grave, please just drop me into icy waters so I freeze instead of drown!\nYuri: Kid's got issues... Well, I guess I'd better tell her everything._Bernadetta: Frigid ocean waters! I can feel them already!\nYuri: Calm, caaaalm. Just listen to me for a moment. There's something I need to tell you. The reason I worked for House Varley, Bernadetta, was to kill you.\nBernadetta: Aha! I knew it! I knew you were out to kill me. Sink me into the deep, dark, freezing depths... Hold on. House Varley? But... why?\nYuri: As you well know, theirs is one of the six great noble houses - the true rulers of the Empire. And you're the heir... with a Crest. There were tons of people who wanted you wiped out. Like people who want to eradicate House Varley. Or a relative who wants the glory for themselves. That particular breed of treacherous nobility... is the kind that'd hire a kid to do their dirty work. The first thing that kid would do? Get close to the target by befriending her, find an in through, say, an assistant gig.\nBernadetta: This kid you're mentioning sounds... real. That was you, wasn't it...\nYuri: Yours truly. My biggest mistake? Getting to know you. I crept into your room one night and readied my blade. The whole thing had been a breeze, up until that moment. I couldn't bring myself to do it. While I hovered there, hesitating, your father came in. You know the rest.\nBernadetta: Why are you telling me this? I'm so confused...\nYuri: Because I want you to look at it objectively. I was hired to kill you. Your father protected you from me, a filthy assassin. He was looking out for you. You're lucky to have a father who cares for you enough to do that.\nBernadetta: Father... protected me? He... protected me...\nYuri: Yeah, why would I lie? At this point, I figure it's you who hates me, and not the other way around.\nBernadetta: I don't hate you, Yuri! But I mean, I do feel weird... But I don't know how to feel... I just... Can't we just be friends? Like back then?\nYuri: You want to be friends? With... me?\nBernadetta: The reason you couldn't kill me was because we were friends. Right?\nYuri: Well...\nBernadetta: You were my first friend. My very first friend. The person who played with me. The first person who went on adventures with me. The first -\nYuri: And you were the first friend I had to baby that much.\nBernadetta: What do you mean?! Well... even so... You were the first friend who cared for me!\nYuri: The whole thing was probably a sham anyway. Though, you know... Even if it was... I did have a lot of fun with you.\nBernadetta: Heh! I knew it!_null_null_null_
