7_41_Byleth: ...\nCaspar: Hey, Professor! What's going on?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Quiet.\nChoice 2: There's a suspicious man...\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: Uh, OK. Why are we being so quiet though? Ah! Look at that guy! He looks pretty suspicious.\nChoice 2 response: A suspicious man? Where? Oh! Is that him?\nCaspar: What do you think he's up to? Never mind that, let's get him!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Let's keep watch for now.\nChoice 2: Suspicion isn't enough to go on.\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: Keep watch? So boring.\nChoice 2 response: Why not? We can figure out what he's up to after we capture him.\nCaspar: My instincts tell me that he's up to no good, and my instincts are never wrong. C'mon, let's get him before he has a chance to strike!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You need to calm down...\nChoice 2: That path he's walking leads to...\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 Response: There's no time to calm down! I'm just gonna— Oh no! The path he's walking down leads to the plaza where the kids play...\nChoice 2 response: Huh? Ahh! It leads to the plaza where the kids play!\nCaspar: There's no way I'm letting this guy get anywhere near those kids!\nCaspar: Urgh...\nKnight of Seiros: Caspar. Why did you disobey your professor?\nCaspar: Ah. Well, I—\nKnight of Seiros: I am not seeking excuses from you. I asked because I want you to consider your actions and apologize for them. It just so happens that you were correct in your assumption that this man was a villain. If that were not so, he would not have chosen to take his own life upon seeing you advancing toward him.\nCaspar: Great! So I was—\nKnight of Seiros: But because of your actions, that is all we know. There is no way for us to know who he was, what he was planning to do, or if he has allies lurking about. The only lead we have is a scorpion tattooed on his arm. If this indicates that he was a member of an underground organization, we have no way of dealing with it! Are you prepared to be held responsible if his group commits a serious crime?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It was my fault for failing to stop him.\nChoice 2: As his professor, I will take responsibility.\nKnight of Seiros: Oh, I couldn't possibly—\nCaspar: What are you talking about, Professor? We didn't do anything wrong! Those kids might've been in danger if we didn't act. I couldn't just stand by and let that happen!\nByleth: ..._Caspar: Hey, Professor. Something's been bothering me... Remember that suspicious guy I chased after back when I was a student? A knight scolded me for it, but at the time, I really thought I was doing the right thing. Now that I've had more experience on the battlefield though...\nKnight of Seiros/Imperial Soldier: I've been looking for you. There isn't much time, so I'll keep this brief. The knights encountered a band of brigands while out marching. It was hard fought, but we prevailed. Our soldiers are highly trained, but the enemy was formidable and we weren't expecting combat... There were a number of casualties among our troops.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I pray for their souls.\nChoice 2: Why report this to me?\nKnight of Seiros/Imperial Soldier:\nChoice 1 response: Much appreciated, but there's a reason I need to bring this to your attention.\nChoice 2 response: There is something I wanted to bring to your attention...\nKnight of Seiros/Imperial Soldier: Do you recall the incident five years ago involving a suspicious individual in Garreg Mach? These brigands all bore the same scorpion tattoo that we found on the arm of that man.\nCaspar: Oh no...\nKnight of Seiros/Imperial Soldier: I thought that might be of interest to you.\nByleth: Thank you.\nKnight of Seiros/Imperial Soldier: Don't mention it. If you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my duties.\nCaspar: Heh. Heck of a coincidence, right? Soon as I mention that suspicious guy, this happens...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: ...\nChoice 2: It's good to hear they've finally been dealt with.\nCaspar: But some of the knights died in combat. They died because of what I did five years ago. This is my fault... If I'd stayed quiet and tracked the guy down like you said, we would've stopped those brigands sooner. And I wouldn't have blood on my hands...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Not necessarily.\nChoice 2: But he might have harmed the children.\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: It's no use trying to comfort me. You know I'm right. Just say it. Those poor knights... It's all my fault...\nChoice 2 response: But he probably wouldn't have! Now those knights... They're not coming back... We both know it... This is all my fault..._Caspar: Do you have a minute, Professor? I gotta talk to you. I've been thinking a lot about those brigands with the scorpion tattoos, and I realized something... I mean, I'll feel better if I get this off my chest, right?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Let's hear it.\nChoice 2: You don't have to tell me.\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: OK. Listen.\nChoice 2 response: No, I really want you to hear this. I've never thought about something so hard in my life! Ok. Listen.\nCaspar: I think... I can't deny who I am. I know you were right five years ago when you told me not to chase after that suspicious guy... But I still can't get over the possibility that he might have hurt those kids. I would have regretted not stopping him for the rest of my life. There's no way I could forgive myself. It sounds awful to say, but the safety of those kids is more important to me than the knights we lost. I'm sorry, Professor, but I can't promise that I won't disobey your orders in the future.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's OK.\nChoice 2: It's my job to take that into account.\nCaspar: I know. It's too big a risk to keep me around... I won't cause a fuss. I'll just pack my bags and— Wait. What?\nByleth: I think you misunderstood.\nCaspar: I-I guess so! You're really OK with me sticking around? Even if I might not always follow orders? People could get hurt if you let me keep doing things my way.\nByleth: We'll make it work.\nCaspar: Just like that? I almost can't believe it... I really struggled to come to this decision, you know! I want to stand by your side, but I won't stop standing up for what I believe in. I know I might cause trouble for everyone, but... I just... You know, I... Oh, I give up. I've got nothing else to say. I should've just kept my mouth shut.\nByleth: It's OK. I'm counting on you.\nCaspar: Yeah, I know. Thanks, Professor. Thanks for accepting me for who I am. I'm glad I get to keep fighting by your side._null_null_null_

We did it!\nByleth: Do you really need to shout?\nCaspar: Huh? Oh! Professor! Um, what are you doing here? Don't you have a lot of important stuff to do? Unlike me, who obviously has a little too much free time...as you can see...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I can't stay away.\nChoice 2: I ran away for a bit.\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: You can't stay away? What's that supposed to mean? I know I can be a little reckless, but I don't need a babysitter! Oh... Do you mean that you snuck out here 'cause you wanted to see me? We can go train, if you want. The training ground isn't too far, and—\nChoice 2 response: Oh... Do you mean that you snuck out here 'cause you wanted to see me?\nByleth: I love you, Caspar. I want to marry you.\nCaspar: You...what? ...\nByleth: ...\nCaspar: ... I don't... I don't really know what to say. I guess I never thought about marriage. I mean, I never had a reason to. Ugh, now I'm babbling. I always secretly hoped I could spend my life with you, but this is so unexpected. Come on! You can't just spring something like this on me! Now I'm flustered and I can't think of the right thing to say. I'm just...so happy. And I can't stop grinning. I bet I look like a real fool right now!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Just a little.\nChoice 2: You have a lovely smile.\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: Well, whose fault is that?! I'm just...this is all a bit much.\nChoice 2 response: Ugh. I knew it. I do have a silly grin on my face.\nCaspar: All right. Now that I've pulled myself together, I want to tell you the same thing you told me. I love you, and I want to marry you! Listen, I know I can be reckless, stubborn, and generally difficult to be around at times... But you once said you'd accept me, even with all of my flaws. When you said that, I made a promise to myself. I promised that I'd always protect you. And, well, sometimes you might have to protect me from myself, but I intend to keep my promise.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Thank you.\nChoice 2: Now I'm going to start grinning too...\nCaspar:\nChoice 1 response: Hah! I'm the one who should be thanking you! Putting up with me and all...\nChoice 2 response: Well, let's see it! I shouldn't be the only one who has to look so ridiculous!\nCaspar: Phew! OK! I gotta let all these emotions out... I know! You should shout with me! Ready?\nByleth: One, two, and...three!\nCaspar: I LOVE YOU FOREVER! Aww, come on! You didn't do it!
7_15_Caspar: Tsa! Ugh! Aah! Yah!\nEdelgard: Training again? You're certainly working hard, Caspar.\nCaspar: Huh, ha! Rah! Hyyyah!\nEdelgard: ...\nCaspar: Oh! Edelgard! You scared me! You shoulda said something.\nEdelgard: I did, but no matter. What has you training with such intensity? It's never good to neglect one's training, but overdoing it is ill-advised as well. You could already give any student here a battle they wouldn't soon forget.\nCaspar: You think so? Thanks! I appreciate that. I can't really stop training though. I gotta get better if I expect to get anywhere in this world.\nEdelgard: If memory serves, you're the second son of House Bergliez, right?\nCaspar: That's right. My older brother is the heir, and there are already too many mouths to feed in our family, so I can't count on any support. I pretty much have to make it on my own, you know?\nEdelgard: I understand. It's difficult being born a noble. Those who inherit everything also inherit great burdens, but the same can be said of those who inherit nothing.\nCaspar: What are you talking about? I don't have any troubles. Who cares if I don't inherit anything? It just means I get to cut a path to my own future. You know what your problem is, Edelgard? You always have to make everything about you.\nEdelgard: Are you picking a fight, Caspar?\nCaspar: Hey now, come on. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. Always happy to fight though, if that's what you want.\nEdelgard: Ugh, I have no desire to bicker with you. Good luck with your training. Good-bye.\nCaspar: What was that about? I'll never understand her..._Edelgard: Caspar, I've been wondering something. Would you be happier if you were the heir to House Bergliez?\nCaspar: Of course! My brother probably wouldn't be too happy about it though. I've got nothing against him, and I'd hate to cause him trouble, so I guess it wouldn't make me very happy at all.\nEdelgard: You may not want to hear this, but your brother is not a good man. He's lazy and greedy and has always relied on the knowledge that he would inherit a title. That's my impression of him, anyway.\nCaspar: You don't hold anything back, do you? But to be honest, you're not too far off. He's got good reason for it though. Our grandfather was really obsessed with his second wife. She has a son who she really wanted to become the heir. In the end though, my grandfather had to step down sooner than expected, so everything went to my father instead. My brother is still really worried about having his future taken from him.\nEdelgard: That's the price of taking your own desires into account when choosing an heir. The concept of nobility is decaying, and it's dragging the Empire into the ground with it.\nCaspar: Wow, this conversation is really going there. You may be right, but it's not like the world is ever going to change, right?\nEdelgard: It must. I intend to create a world where the best are free to rise to the top and succeed, regardless of their bloodline. The nobility as it is now could not exist in a world like that. I'll make sure of it.\nCaspar: What do you think would happen to me in that kind of world? Would you appoint me as a general or Minister of Military Affairs?\nEdelgard: If you were the best suited for that position, I would.\nCaspar: Right, so my life would pretty much stay the same. I'd still have to train, get stronger, and use my abilities to cut my own path. I don't know what I'm going to do after we graduate. I guess I'll just have to fight for you.\nEdelgard: Is that so?\nCaspar: At the base, the front lines, or wherever we might be fighting, I'll be there with all my might! Raaar!\nEdelgard: ..._Caspar: Huh? What's wrong, Edelgard?\nEdelgard: Hm? Why do you ask?\nCaspar: You always look at me funny, but right now you're looking at me more...normal.\nEdelgard: Heh, you can seem rather oblivious, but then you go and shock me with your keen insight.\nCaspar: Whoa. That's a little harsh.\nEdelgard: Is it? You only have yourself to blame for the reputation. As for me, I've always thought of you as something of a victim.\nCaspar: What is that supposed to mean?!\nEdelgard: I mean you're a victim of Fódlan's antiquated system of nobility. You're skilled and you work hard, yet you still play second fiddle to your less capable older brother. Even still, you fight on not allowing yourself to be discouraged by it all. People like you help to fuel my fire. If I can only smash this rotten system, I could save you.\nCaspar: You've always got a whole lot to say about your grand plans for the future...\nEdelgard: Just hear me out. I've realized...that I was wrong about you. I can now see that you've found a way to live the life you want to live. Simply put, you love working hard, and you love training. You don't know the meaning of surrender. I never thought such a genuine person could really exist.\nCaspar: That's a lot to take in...you're not too far off though. I try to live life the way I want to. I wasn't that way when we first met, but I've changed since then. Nowadays, what you see is what you get.\nEdelgard: It doesn't matter that you have burdens to bear. Despite that, you never stray from your path. You don't let anything tie you down. I can hardly imagine a life like that. To be honest, I'm a bit jealous.\nCaspar: Well, I don't think I could live the way you do, but I admire you for sticking to it. You never let your burdens get you down. You try to push through them instead. If I'm being honest, I changed my mind about you a while back.\nEdelgard: Is that so?\nCaspar: You can be real critical of yourself, and you admit it when you make a mistake.\nEdelgard: That's true. I certainly make mistakes, but I feel it's important to own up to them.\nCaspar: I probably make twice as many mistakes as you, but I don't notice half of 'em! Hahaha!\nEdelgard: This is no laughing matter, Caspar. Then again, that's part of how you choose to live as well, isn't it?\nCaspar: That it is! But it doesn't change what I promised before. I'm gonna keep fighting for you, Edelgard. Even if we don't live our lives the same way, I'll help cut a path through so you can follow safely behind!\nEdelgard: Heh heh, I don't doubt it. The future is ours, Caspar. I'm counting on you to help clear the way._null_null_null_
7_23_Caspar: Yaaah! Urrraaah! I'm not finished with you! I. Am. Caspar! Hiiiyahhh!\nHubert: ...\nCaspar: What's going on, Hubert? You need something?\nHubert: I watched you training earlier. Pitiful display.\nCaspar: Uh, excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?\nHubert: You yell before every move.\nCaspar: I know. I do it on purpose. It's how I get fired up. That a problem for you? You scared?\nHubert: Stupid habit. If you value your life, you'll break it.\nCaspar: What are you talking about? It sounds like you might have a problem with me.\nHubert: As a matter of fact, I do. If it was only your own idiotic life at stake, I wouldn't bother saying anything. But it's not. Your foolishness hurts everyone.\nCaspar: Ooh, you sure do love to hear yourself talk.\nHubert: Suppose you were to shout on the battlefield as you did in your training today. It is very likely the enemy could anticipate your next move based on your insipid blather. And what if your allies are startled by your outburst, and fumble with their weapons as a result? This is not to mention the obvious fact that you would utterly botch any covert operation.\nCaspar: You really think I'm that stupid? I only shout when it's completely necessary. I don't do it all the time!\nHubert: Whatever habits you develop in training, you will reproduce on the battlefield. Combat is tense and frantic. You will default to your training whether you mean to or not.\nCaspar: Hey! Why don't you just shut up about it? I can control myself._Hubert: You were rather quiet in the last battle, Caspar. Not a single war cry to be heard. It was almost as if you weren't even there.\nCaspar: I did it just for you, Hubert. Isn't that what you wanted? Weren't you the one who said my shouting would cause problems?\nHubert: Yes, I was. And at the time, you seemed intent on ignoring my advice.\nCaspar: Well, that was then. Recently my behavior... caused trouble. Just like you said it would. I was shouting the other day and some enemies heard. I pretty much gave our position away and left us open to attack. I mean, it turned out fine in the end, but someone could've died if things had played out differently. Anyway, I did some self-reflecting and realized that I probably shouldn't shout so much. A decision that I'm proud to say I came to all on my own.\nHubert: All on your own, huh? It was a bad decision. Being too quiet on the battlefield is extremely dangerous.\nCaspar: I'm sorry, what? That's the exact opposite of what you said before!\nHubert: Having seen you fight in silence, I have no choice but to accept the truth that your shouting is vital.\nCaspar: What in the world are you talking about?\nHubert: We've all grown used to the way you fight. Your battle cries help morale. And your instructions rise above the din of battle. I would go so far as to say that the soldiers under your command would be lost without the guidance of your booming voice.\nCaspar: I really don't get you, Hubert.\nHubert: You inspire people. The benefits of your shouting outweigh the risks.\nCaspar: ...\nHubert: Something wrong?\nCaspar: YEEEAAAH! I'M BAAACK! IF YOU WANT ME TO SHOUT, THEN I'M GONNA SHOUT! I'M NOT EVEN GONNA THINK ABOUT IT! I KNEW YOU'D COME AROUND!\nHubert: Don't get too excited. You'll be ambushed again.\nCaspar: Then I guess I'm gonna have to fight some guys while shouting! Hwahahaha!\nHubert: That might have been the wrong approach. Ah, well. No cure for stupidity. I suppose I'll just have to rein him in myself._null_null_null_null_
7_17_Caspar: That settles that. And don't even think about brawling around here again!\nFerdinand: Impressive, Caspar. Well done.\nCaspar: Hey, Ferdinand! Did you see that fight?\nFerdinand: I saw it from start to finish. Both parties were at fault, disturbing the peace. Then you stepped in and corrected their behavior. You are setting a good example. I am proud to call you my fellow noble.\nCaspar: Your fellow noble? I wasn't even thinking about nobility. That had nothing to do with it.\nFerdinand: Excuse me, \"nothing\"? Resolving conflicts among commonfolk is a duty of the nobles. Is that not what you were doing?\nCaspar: I guess so? But it was more like instinct or something. I saw people acting out of line so I had to step in.\nFerdinand: Ah. You were acting on impulse. You might be better served following moral convictions rather than instincts. Take me, for example. I always bear in mind that I am a noble and behave accordingly. The fortunate help the unfortunate. That is my guiding principle.\nCaspar: I never have any idea what you're talking about. If someone's in trouble, you gotta help them out. Simple as that.\nFerdinand: Hmph. A difference of opinion, you might say. Very well then. Believe what you will. I will not expend energy trying to change your mind.\nCaspar: Maybe all of this \"noble\" stuff just isn't for me—hey! Don't walk away when I'm talking to you!_Ferdinand: Caspar. I have been waiting.\nCaspar: Ferdinand. Waiting for what?\nFerdinand: I am going to give you a lesson on the righteous path of the noble.\nCaspar: Righteous path—what? You have a problem with my \"path\" now? You think you're more \"righteous\" than me?\nFerdinand: That remains to be seen. I heard you stopped a robbery in town the other day. Some despicable thief who was robbing an elderly shopkeeper. Rumor has it you didn't wreak as much havoc as usual.\nCaspar: Hey, now. I think you're underestimating me here. When the thief showed up, the old shopkeeper was so scared that he could barely stand. I didn't want the guy to pass out, so I had to stay calm while handling the situation. Rather than fighting, I gave my own money to the thief and told him to get out of there. Or else.\nFerdinand: How, uh, magnanimous of you.\nCaspar: The thief fell for it and left the shop. That's when I chased him down. I got my money back and gave the thief a good beating. He won't be back here anytime soon.\nFerdinand: Ah, so you walloped the scoundrel. That does sound like you. I am finding this story more plausible. Nevertheless, I think—\nCaspar: Hold on! Now it's your turn. I heard a very interesting story about you recently.\nFerdinand: My turn, eh? Let's hear this story, then.\nCaspar: The way I heard it, you punched a foreign soldier. Right in the middle of town.\nFerdinand: Stop, stop. I know what you are getting at, but you have the wrong idea.\nCaspar: Let's hear your version, then.\nFerdinand: I had been browsing for weapons at a run-down stall. Suddenly, a man seized the stall's owner and started dragging him away! Someone with a less generous spirit might say the peddler had it coming. His wares were quite inferior, after all. But without a moment's hesitation, I leapt to his aid and soundly defeated the goon!\nCaspar: Well done. Sounds exciting.\nFerdinand: It was nothing, really. Anyway, the old shopkeeper let me in on the details. He said that he was a novice trader, tricked by a noble into selling low-quality goods. That ruse was about to come to light. So the noble had sent a mercenary to keep the shopkeeper silent.\nCaspar: So, that's what really happened. I just heard you snapped and attacked some noble's servant. I figured it was worth asking about.\nFerdinand: Well, I won't deny it. I forgot my rank for a moment and let my instincts take over.\nCaspar: Is there something wrong with that? It sounds a little like something I would do.\nFerdinand: And your, uh, gentle approach to handling that robbery... That sounds like something I might do. You were not overcome by your impulses. You kept a cool head. For the most part.\nCaspar: I think we're starting to rub off on each other. Always looking for a way to defend justice, and to lift each other up!\nFerdinand: Partners in justice, eh? Well now. That I can agree to._null_null_null_null_
7_28_Caspar: You're looking pretty tired, Linhardt. I think you could use a little more of the fighting spirit!\nLinhardt: I believe you have enough fighting spirit for the both of us.\nCaspar: Enough? There's no such thing! You need as much as you can get it if you're going to train.\nLinhardt: I'd rather pace myself. You're becoming too much like your father. I still recall with startling clarity the time he forced me to do some training.\nCaspar: Ha! I remember your father wasn't too happy about that. Our fathers actually got into a fight over it.\nLinhardt: They hate one another so much. I simply cannot fathom what's wrong with the two of them.\nCaspar: I wish they'd just have it out already. One big fight to settle things. My father would win, obviously, but it would still be fun to watch.\nLinhardt: That would be rather cruel. I don't think anyone in Fódlan could beat up your father. My father does have the height advantage though...\nCaspar: Pfft! Height advantage? What does that even mean?\nLinhardt: When two opponents are of similar strength, the one with the height advantage wins. It's pure math.\nCaspar: Whoever forces the other to submit wins. That's how fighting works. It has nothing to do with height!\nLinhardt: Brute strength alone doesn't decide a fight, and taller people have longer limbs too. Longer limbs equates to a longer reach. Taller people can hit you from farther away. Oh, and they have more leg strength. There's also th— Well, I'm bored explaining this. I think you get my point.\nCaspar: No, I don't get it. Now you're talking about limb length and reach? None of that matters when you're up close and brawling!\nLinhardt: You know, I'm going to agree with you just so I don't have to keep talking.\nCaspar: If you've got something else to say, then come out and say it! Actually, forget this! I'll prove it to you myself. Some of those new knights look pretty tall. I'll fight one just for you!\nLinhardt: And off he goes...\nCaspar: Ugh, they're all so strong... I couldn't land a single blow.\nLinhardt: So it's as I said, then, isn't it? The tallest fighter has the advantage...and my father could beat yours in a fight._Caspar: Why am I having so much trouble fighting these tall guys? They're not even stronger than me? You've got to help me come up with a strategy, Linhardt.\nLinhardt: Is that not a waste of time? Even if I handed you a perfect strategy— something I've done in the past — you'd never follow it through.\nCaspar: That's because your plans are always so complicated! But come on, I need your help.\nLinhardt: All right. I will share with you my tactical genius. I call this...my \"secret plan.\"\nCaspar: You already have a plan? You really are ready for anything. So, what is it?\nLinhardt: Land the first hit. Then keep hitting them — hard and fast as you can —until they stop hitting you back.\nCaspar: So, you're basically telling me to just...fight?\nLinhardt: Dodge their attacks. Keep up the assault. Then go for the knees. Done.\nCaspar: The secret is the knees?\nLinhardt: Being tall means short people are closer to your knees. Exploit the enemy's weakness, Caspar!\nCaspar: Makes sense! That doesn't sound like my style though. I don't really wanna exploit a weakness.\nLinhardt: Then go ahead and continue losing. Or...you can listen to the rest of my plan.\nCaspar: There's more? Fine. Tell me the rest.\nLinhardt: Your defense is careless. The last bit of my secret is that you need to train in that area.\nCaspar: I won't argue with training. Let's go!\nLinhardt: No, I don't think we should —\nCaspar: C'mon! You've even got that height advantage you're always going on about. You're the perfect training partner for me. Quit stalling and let's go!\nLinhardt: Ugh, fine. I'll train with you, but only for a bit.\nCaspar: All right, Linhardt! Come at me again!\nLinhardt: Uh... Ah... Caspar, please... I need... I need... Water... I need water... I'm going to... Gonna go get some. Bye.\nCaspar: Huh? Hey! Get back here! Hmph! He got away..._Linhardt: Huh? Caspar? Whatever is he doing here? Oh no... Is he looking for a fight with someone taller than him? The poor boy won't give up.\nCaspar: This is it. Today's my day. Caspar's day! Come get some!\nLinhardt: Yes, Caspar, just like that! Just like we practiced! Yes! Dodge! Yes! Perfect! Right there! He's open! Punch him right in the — Yes, Caspar! You did it!\nCaspar: Hahaha! And that's how it's done!\nCaspar: And then I got him — BAM! Right in the solar plexus! I really wish you coulda- Hey! Are you even listening? This is when it starts getting real good!\nLinhardt: I'm listening. I am sad to say, however, that the tale is slightly less thrilling the fourth time through.\nCaspar: You should be more excited! We finally won!\nLinhardt: \"We\"?\nCaspar: Yeah! I couldn't have done it without your advice! You're a strategic genius, Linhardt!\nLinhardt: Nonsense. Your strength carried the day. I just rambled on. You're the one who did the actual work. What's really amazing is how you wouldn't give up.\nCaspar: Whoa. I've never heard you compliment me before. I don't think I like it... Seriously though, I couldn't have done it without you! Like you said, I wouldn't give up on fighting, and I'm not gonna give up on this either!\nLinhardt: I should have expected that, I suppose. That's just the kind of guy you are after all. I guess this friendship is something that we can never escape from...ever.\nCaspar: Are you saying you wanna escape from our friendship?\nLinhardt: Not at all. Even if I did, our fates would not be so easily untangled.\nCaspar: Hah! You got that right! No one can break this bond! Even if we argue and but heads sometimes... We'll never have to fight it out, and that's a promise!\nLinhardt: Understood. I don't desire to fight anyone anyway. This war is the last time I'll set foot on a battlefield.\nCaspar: Well, that makes sense.\nLinhardt: Let's you and I come out the other side of this war alive and well, OK? That is a promise worth making.\nCaspar: Definitely! And let's win this thing while we're at it!_null_null_null_
7_14_Dorothea: Oh, Caspar! Just who I was hoping to see. I have a tiny little request, if you have time to help me.\nCaspar: I'm always happy to help. What can I do for you?\nDorothea: That is exactly what I was hoping to hear. Would you mind coming along to my room?\nCaspar: Your... room? Uh. OK.\n[Fade to black]\nCaspar: Ugh... this... isn't what I... had in mind!\nDorothea: Come on. A big strong guy like you? This is easy. Lift up the cabinet, please. I need to dust behind it.\nCaspar: There's still more to do? Why do you care so much about keeping this place clean? It's just a dorm room.\nDorothea: Leaving this place a mess wouldn't be fair to the next person who's assigned here. In fact, I think once we're done with this room, we should clean up your room as well.\nCaspar: Yeah, I don't think so. I have some actual training to do.\nDorothea: Oh, come to think of it, I have a date myself. The fella I'm seeing has quite a charming face, rich family, and, I assume, a tolerable personality.\nCaspar: Don't you get tired of spending time with all of these guys who have \"tolerable personalities\"?\nDorothea: Oh, it gets tedious at times. You must listen to them talk, for one thing. But it's important for my future.\nCaspar: That's how I see my training. I guess it's pretty much the same thing.\nDorothea: I don't know if that's a comparison you really want to make.\nCaspar: Why not? Seems about right to me. Sure, I'm a noble, but I'm also a second son. I don't have anything coming to me. Why do you think I'm always training so much? I need to prove myself on the battlefield if I plan on making it anywhere in this world. I know you don't have noble status or wealth, so you're putting in the effort to marry well, right? See? Pretty much the same thing.\nDorothea: I suppose... It would be nice if everyone saw it that way. Well then, Caspar, I need to get ready for my date, but shall we both agree to work hard for our futures?\nCaspar: Absolutely. I just hope our efforts are worth it!_Caspar: Hey, Dorothea. Something's been bothering me. I kinda feel like you act more casually around me than you do with other people.\nDorothea: Casually? I don't know what you mean.\nCaspar: I just feel like you're always asking me to do things that might make other people uncomfortable. Like when you asked me to clean your room. You're not very flirty toward me like you are with the other guys. You seem weirdly comfortable around me.\nDorothea: You pay more attention than I would've thought. Hey, are you interested in me? You know, \"interested\" interested?\nCaspar: What? Uh, no! I—um. It just seemed weird and I was curious.\nDorothea: I'm kidding. It's true that I do find you quite a convenient little helper at times. It's like you're... how to put it? You're like a little brother to me.\nCaspar: Ugh. Really? That's not exactly a compliment.\nDorothea: No, but it's true, and now that I've thought about it, I like the whole idea. Why don't you try calling me \"big sis\" and see how it feels?\nCaspar: No, no. That's not gonna happen.\nDorothea: Why not?\nCaspar: I'm embarrassed just thinking about it.\nDorothea: Oh, come on. It's just a goof. You can manage it at least once, can't you? Please? I know! If you do it, I'll stop using you for my chores. How's that sound?\nCaspar: That's... an enticing offer. Fine. Once. Big sis...\nDorothea: Well done, Caspar! You're such a cute little boy, I'm proud to have you as a sibling.\nCaspar: I'm not cute, and I'm not little! How would you feel if I made you call me \"big bro\"?\nDorothea: Oh? Well, I wouldn't mind that at all, big bro.\nCaspar: ...\nDorothea: Is something wrong, \"big bro\"?\nCaspar: Aaagh! This is the worst._Dorothea: Hey, Caspar! Care to join me for tea?\nCaspar: Again? Let's make it quick. I gotta get some training in eventually.\nDorothea: More training? Don't you get tired of it?\nCaspar: No, I don't get tired of working toward my goals, unlike you.\nDorothea: Me? What do you mean?\nCaspar: Your quest for the perfect husband! I haven't seen you wasting time with any dull-looking guys lately.\nDorothea: Oh, that... Maybe I just found something worth staying in for.\nCaspar: You mean in the monastery? This place is a dump compared to what it was five years ago...\nDorothea: That's not what I'm talking about. Honestly, Caspar, you don't understand women at all.\nCaspar: Well, excuse me! Maybe I'm just another dull guy.\nDorothea: That must be why you don't pick up on how I feel.\nCaspar: Uh, what?\nDorothea: When I'm around you, I feel like, well... like I can always be myself. I don't need to act differently or flirt... or lie. I can just be me. I always said you were little brother material, but... When we're alone like this, the idea of marriage—\nCaspar: Nope! Hold it right there! I'm gonna need a minute! I was not ready for this!\nDorothea: Caspar? Settle. You might be getting the wrong idea. I was only saying, when I'm with you like this, I can forget all about marriage and just be friends.\nCaspar: Huh? Right! Of course!\nDorothea: Though, I suppose relationships like that can also lead to marriage.\nCaspar: Now I know you're messing with me.\nDorothea: I'm not trying to tease. I was just thinking out loud. If neither of us ever find our special someone... It might not be so bad to settle down and spend the rest of our lives together. What do you think?\nCaspar: I... haven't really thought about that. I'm not really the... romance type. Spending the rest of my life with you doesn't sound so bad though. But why are we even talking about this? There's no way you won't find someone great!\nDorothea: Stranger things have happened.\nCaspar: Either way, no point in worrying about it now. I'm plenty happy with our current situation! Let's just focus on staying good friends.\nDorothea: Good idea. Here's to us._null_null_null_
7_34_Caspar: All right! Time for some more— Oh. Petra. Hi.\nPetra: Caspar! Do you want to train with each other?\nCaspar: Uh, yeah. Sure.\nPetra: You have had new training recently. And great improvements. I want great improvement too. Will you give me help?\nCaspar: Well, hey! Look at that! You pay more attention than I gave you credit for. I have been trying new training methods. They're definitely paying off. My movements are much sharper lately, more precise.\nPetra: I am knowing that! I want that too. You teach. I learn. We both get more strength. It will be greatness.\nCaspar: All right. I mean, I guess we can give it a shot. Um, Petra.\nPetra: Yes, Caspar?\nCaspar: Uh, no. Never mind. Sorry, I was just... thinking about something else. Nothing at all! Let's train!\nPetra: I heard a question in your voice. Say it.\nCaspar: No, no, no. It's really nothing. Don't worry about it.\nPetra: OK. I will not be worrying. Can we begin the training?\nCaspar: Ugh! Fine! We can talk about it if you insist. You can stop pretending like you don't know.\nPetra: What am I knowing?\nCaspar: About my father.\nPetra: Your father? He is of the military, in the Empire. I hear he has great skill.\nCaspar: No, not that. Well, it's kind of about that... I'm talking about when Dagda and Brigid invaded the Empire. My father led the Empire's army that fended off the invaders. Your father was in that battle. Did you really not know? My father killed yours.\nPetra: You... How long have you had this knowing?\nCaspar: I just found out recently. I had no idea before then, but it's all I've been able to think about since...\nPetra: So, now you have the truth.\nCaspar: Petra? Damn it! What am I supposed to do now?_Petra: Caspar. That equipment is new. It is suiting... it suits you.\nCaspar: Oh. Uh, right. Thanks.\nPetra: You get more strength each day. I do not want to be falling behind.\nCaspar: I'm impressed with how much stronger you've gotten too. More than I—\nPetra: No! Caspar, you are impressing to me. I want to be training with you.\nCaspar: Just hold on, Petra!\nPetra: What is wrong?\nCaspar: It's your attitude! How can you act so casual around me? My father killed your father. You shouldn't be able to stand the sight of me! You actually hate me, right? That's fine. I can take it. I completely understand. Just be honest! Give it to me straight.\nPetra: ...\nCaspar: If our roles were reversed, I don't think I'd be able to forgive you. I don't understand how you can—\nPetra: You are not the one who did the killing, Caspar. Our parents had... conflict, but we are not them. I have no worry about it. You should not either.\nCaspar: I don't need to worry? Impossible! I don't think I'll ever be—\nPetra: You must. If not, the conflict... will keep carrying on. If children cannot forgive, it will not ever have an ending. Is that what you are wanting?\nCaspar: Of course not, I—\nPetra: Please, give it some thinking. I will be leaving now._Caspar: Hey, Petra. How's training going?\nPetra: It is going well. I am not having any troubles right now.\nCaspar: Good, good... At least things haven't gotten worse, right? Heh. So... did, uh... Did you hear what happened the other day? The professor really—\nPetra: Caspar.\nCaspar: Oh! Whoa! OK, there's no need for that!\nPetra: You are the son of my father's killer. That means I must be killing you and taking revenge.\nCaspar: What?! I thought you said it wasn't a big deal! We're not our parents and all that!\nPetra: Your optimism is not making sense. It is not possible that you are not having hatred for me. My father was killed. By the Empire. By your father. And so I will be impaling you on this blade to be satisfying a deep wish of mine.\nCaspar: A deep wish... What are you talking about?!\nPetra: I am talking about my wish. Of course... I am also having another wish. An even deeper wish. I wish for you and I to keep being friends. To keep fighting and surviving together. When you are speaking of your father, it is with a proud smile that injures my heart. But that is only a small thing. You also are working harder than anyone I am knowing. So... I can't bring myself to be killing you.\nCaspar: I see... So, you do hate me because of what happened, but... you still want to be my friend? You haven't stabbed me yet... so you obviously want me to live more than you want me to die... I hope?\nPetra: That must be the truth. More than all of it, I am not wishing to be losing you. it would give me great sadness.\nCaspar: OK, that's a relief! I don't want to lose you either, and I definitely don't want to fight you. To be honest, if things were the other way around... I don't think I'd be able to forgive you. I'd hate you, and I'd hate myself for feeling that way.\nPetra: Caspar...\nCaspar: But you're not like that! You see me as your ally... and your friend. You had the chance to kill me, but you used it to show me that you want me to live. You really are an incredible person, Petra. I want to be more like you. I want to prove that I'm a good friend. I promise, you won't regret letting me live!\nPetra: You have my gratitude for your understanding. Hearing your words gives me great happiness. I was always feeling a... barrier between our hearts. I am sure I was also the one putting it there. But from now onward, I will be sharing all of my heart with you. My grief and anger, joy and love. All of it.\nCaspar: I'd like that, Petra. From now on, we'll be more honest and open with each other._null_null_null_
7_35_Caspar: Hey, Raphael. You here to train?\nRaphael: Hey! Caspar! You work your muscles almost as much as I do.\nCaspar: Of Course! Everyone knows that if you skip a day, you'll lose three days of work.\nRaphael: Ain't that the truth. Let's get to it then!\nCaspar: That's probably... enough for today.\nRaphael: Ughh... Ughh... You might be right. I'm exhausted!\nCaspar: You know... I really envy you, Raphael... You're huge!\nRaphael: I know I'm big. Everyone knows that. What are you talking about?\nCaspar: I'm not very big, but I've always wanted to be. That's why I train so much. I've grown a bit in the last five years, but I'm still not even close to you. I just don't know how to bulk up.\nRaphael: Is that all? I know how to fix that!\nCaspar: Really? You gotta show me!\nRaphael: Follow me!\nCaspar: Huh? You just led me to the dining hall.\nRaphael: That's right. Now sit down and eat up!\nCaspar: We're just gonna eat?\nRaphael: Yup. Eating's the best way to get bigger! You gotta eat, and you gotta train. Do 'em both enough and you're sure to grow.\nCaspar: I always thought I was a pretty big eater, but maybe I wasn't eating enough? Or not often enough?\nRaphael: Probably both. Look at my plate compared to yours. Now this is a meal!\nCaspar; Whoa! Your plate looks like a mountain! If that's what I gotta so, then I'm gonna eat until I can't anymore. I'll eat until there's no food left!\nRaphael: That's the spirit! C'mon! Let's go clear out the pantry.\nCaspar: Let's do it! I'm gonna eat till I can't move!_Raphael: Caspar! Good to see you! You're looking a bit bigger lately!\nCaspar: Yeah, Raphael. That's one way to put it.\nRaphael: Is something wrong? I thought you wanted to get bigger. Have you been training?\nCaspar: I haven't missed a day. The problem is that my body doesn't want to grow in the directions I want it to. I was hoping to get a little taller, but I seem to just be growing...wider. I don't think your methods are for me.\nRaphael: Aww, that's too bad. I always thought that the secret to getting bigger was lots of eating and training! You know what? You shouldn't worry so much about how big or tall you are. You're great, no matter what size!\nCaspar: What makes you say that?\nRaphael: Well, let's see... You can run faster than me. And you're really agile, which I will never be. That's just about your legs though. your other movements are quick too! You can dodge good, and swing a sword pretty fast. Oh! And your...\nCaspar: All right, Raphael. I think I see the problem now. I thought I envied the size of your body, but I was wrong. After hearing you say those nice things about me, I realized that I actually envy the size of your heart.\nRaphael: Huh? I think it's normal size, but...\nCaspar: That's right! I don't just need a bigger body, I need a bigger heart! Once I have a bigger heart, then maybe, just maybe, my body will start growing too!\nRaphael: Yeah! Maybe...\nCaspar: Now how do I increase the size of my heart? It didn't help with my body, but do you think eating will make my heart grow?\nRaphael: I have no idea, but I'm always up for a meal.\nCaspar: I really don't want to get any wider though... I'm so conflicted... I guess there's only one way to find out. It's like you always say, \"when in doubt, go to the dining hall!\"_null_null_null_null_
7_22_Caspar: Agh. That doesn't feel good at all. Why did he have to punch me so hard?\nHilda: Hey, Caspar. Something the matter?\nCaspar: Oh! Uh, hi, Hilda. I just got into a little fight. No big deal. I definitely won.\nHilda: Your face is all swollen! That looks painful. Come on, let's get you to the infirmary.\nCaspar: No, no. That's really too much. Like I said, I'm fine.\nHilda: Don't argue, just come along. You look ghoulish!\nCaspar: Huh? Maybe it's worse than I thought... Whatever. It can't hurt to have it looked at.\nHilda: There. That should do it! You'll be all right now.\nCaspar: Great! Thanks, Hilda. I had no idea you were so good at this.\nHilda: I always tended to my big brother's wounds, so I have lots of experience. I'm curious though. Why are you always getting into fights? You really got hurt. Surely it would have been better not to bother.\nCaspar: It's not like I go looking for fights. And I'm not always the one who starts them! There are just a lot of guys in this world who won't listen to reason. Somebody's gotta beat some sense into them!\nHilda: Hm. So that's why you're always picking fights. Why not ignore them? Or ask someone else for help?\nCaspar: Maybe that's how you'd handle it, but I can't just look the other way.\nHilda: How very gallant, but maybe you should try showing a little restraint.\nCaspar: You really think that?\nHilda: Yes I do. I don't think you can solve all your problems by throwing a few punches. The world's a big place. At this moment, all over Fódlan, countless people are in some kind of trouble. But they'll figure things out one way or another, even without you there. Try to hold back and see what happens. Maybe you'll be surprised. Besides, if you're always picking fights, you might get so badly injured that you can't protect me!\nCaspar: Now that's a good point right there. I guess I could give this whole \"restraint\" thing a shot._Caspar: Ugh. There they go, starting another fight! I'm just gonna march over and-\nCaspar: Wait. No. I have to restrain myself.\nCaspar: Hmmm. Urghhh. Gah! I can't do it! Hey! You! Stop right there!\nHilda: Poor Caspar. He can't stop himself. He does look quite heroic though... and seems to be having a good time.\nCaspar: Hah! That takes care of that! Oh. Oh no. Were you watching just now?\nHilda: Who, me? Watching what?\nCaspar: The, uh... the fight that just happened? The fight that I definitely didn't start! I've been trying to restrain myself like you said, and I've been so good about it too, but they pulled me in! I tried to keep back but — Ugh!\nCaspar: OK! You got me! I can't restrain myself! I just don't have it in me. But the bad guys were dealt with, so it turned out fine, right?\nHilda: Yes, completely fine. If that's what you want to do, who am I to complain?\nCaspar: Really? You're not gonna tell me how disappointed you are and that I need to be better? I figured you'd be mad, but you're actually smiling.\nHilda: Ah, no use in getting mad. In fact, I found the whole spectacle to be very entertaining. You seemed to be enjoying yourself.\nCaspar: I was! I mean... Sometimes I just can't help myself and I gotta get out there, haha.\nCaspar: Wait a minute. So you were watching! Why didn't you try and stop me?\nHilda: Me, stop you? As if! I would never voluntarily go to so much trouble. Besides, you were fighting with so much passion, I couldn't help but feel smitten.\nCaspar: Smitten? Wow, you must really love a good fight. I gotta admit, that one was pretty good. I guess I love fighting too._Caspar: Hey, Hilda. Can I ask you something?\nHilda: Heya, Caspar. Sure, go ahead.\nCaspar: Well, you know that thing you do where you flirt with guys and get them to do stuff for you? Why don't you ever do that with me?\nHilda: Oh, you want me to take advantage of you, eh? I'm happy to oblige. You're surprisingly sharp.\nCaspar: Heh, you know, I just... Wait. \"Surprisingly\"? What's that supposed to mean?\nHilda: I didn't think there was much point in taking advantage of you. You're not one to do favors. So, I just never bothered. it seems like less trouble to do things myself.\nCaspar: You really think I'm so heartless that I wouldn't be willing to help you out? I'd be happy to help! Depending on what it is you need.\nHilda: That's not my style though. I don't ask people to do favors for me. I prefer for them to notice what I want and offer to do it themselves. You're not attentive enough to notice. But you do notice that I'm working my charms on others? How bizarre.\nCaspar: I guess that makes sense. Sorry I've been so oblivious to your needs... But why can't you just ask?\nHilda: Well, when i ask someone for help, it's awkward for them to say no. So they go along with it, even if they don't want to. But when they offer to help, everyone feels better about themselves!\nCaspar: Sure, but if your plan is to guilt someone into offering their help, isn't that the same? Or worse?\nHilda: Oh, my dear Caspar! Guilt isn't why they offer. But that's neither here nor there. I don't want to feel like I'm constraining you. I like your carefree lifestyle.\nCaspar: I'm not sure I follow, but I like the way you live too. Not being tied down by anything or anyone sounds like a pretty easy life. I get that. If there's anything you really need help with though, don't be afraid to ask me. Sometimes you just can't afford to wait around for someone else to notice.\nHilda: That's sweet, Caspar. Thanks! Well, since you're offering, why don't you come to my room? I thought of something you can do for me.\nCaspar:Your room? Are you redecorating? Or moving out?\nHilda: You're really oblivious, huh? I don't know what to do with you, Caspar.\nCaspar: I don't follow.\nHilda: I, uh, could use some help carrying luggage.\nCaspar: Is that it? That's not problem at all!_Caspar: You know, Hilda. I really appreciate how open-minded you are.\nHilda: Oh? How do you mean?\nCaspar: People usually try to hold me back when I get into a fight. Not you though. I like that about you. What was it again? You like a good fight? Yeah, I remember it now...\nHilda: I'm not sure where you got that from. I try to avoid conflict of all kinds.\nCaspar: That can't be right. you complimented my fighting. Said you were smitten by it.\nHilda: Hmm. Well, if you really must know... I want to live freely, with nothing tying me down. So your uninhibited attitude does appeal to me. You don't let rules hold you back. You do things your way and no one else's.\nCaspar: That makes sense. I guess I am pretty impressive You're really amazing too, you know that?\nHilda: Aw, me? \"Amazing\"? Shucks. I'm sure I don't know what you mean.\nCaspar: I think most people like to force their ideas on everyone else. They'll tell someone off it they don't like how the other person is living. Try to make them change, even if they don't want to. You're different though. You let people live however they want. There aren't a lot of people like you in the world.\nHilda: Oh stop! You're going to make me blush. No one's ever paid me so many compliments.\nCaspar: Come on. really?\nHilda: My big brother liked to tell me how lazy and careless I was. I've gotten scolds aplenty, but compliments I'm not accustomed to.\nCaspar: That's surprising, but I don't think you should let it bother you so much. You shouldn't let anyone change you, or else you'll end up losing the qualities that make you so great.\nHilda: I...suppose you're right. Wow. Thanks, Caspar. We should live our own lives, and stop worrying about others' opinions!_B+_null_
7_8_Caspar: Hiyaaahhh!\nCatherine: Not this time!\nCaspar: How ... about ... this!?\nCatherine: Too slow!\nCaspar: You're mine now!\nCatherine: Not quite!\nCaspar: Hahh ... Hahh ... Aaah! Why can't I do it!?\nCatherine: What's wrong Caspar? Worn out already? You said you wanted to keep going until you managed to hit me.\nCaspar: I'm gonna hit you! Just ... just let me catch my breath. Losing to you over and over again is exhausting.\nCatherine: That's because you rely on sheer power. You're moving around more than you have to, and it's a waste of energy. You need to start using your head, or you'll never even land a blow.\nCaspar: Well, you were taking some pretty big swings yourself, you know!\nCatherine: I have more experience than you. I can use my energy more efficiently.\nCaspar: Yes, I guess that makes sense. You are the famous Thunder Catherine, after all. Wait. I just realized something. I get to train with the legendary wielder of Thunderbrand!\nCatherine: Why is that just occurring to you?\nCaspar: I guess it didn't really sink in until now. I'm training with someone I've always looked up to! You're a legend! Everyone knew about the power of Thunderbrand, even in the empire!\nCatherine: Stop. I'm not nearly that impressive.\nCaspar: But you are! When I was younger, my friends and I would fight over who got to pretend to use Thunderbrand whenever we would play.\nCatherine: If they actually saw me fighting, I doubt that game would be very popular. I will cut down anyone, even a child, for the sake of my mission. On the battlefield, there is no Thunder Catherine. Only a bloodied soldier, crawling in the mud, hacking desperately at her enemies.\nCaspar: Sure, but --\nCatherine: I'm not a hero. I fight only for Lady Rhea and the goddess. What about me is admirable, hm? Is it my deeds ... or my blade?\nCaspar: ..._Catherine: Hey, Caspar. You look more troubled than usual.\nCaspar: Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about the last time we talked. I really admire your strength, and I want to be like you on the battlefield, but I don't agree with your idea of justice. If that's the case, is it bad for me to look up to you? I'm not sure how to feel anymore.\nCatherine: I can't answer that. You'll need to find the answer on your own. I can offer one piece of advice, however.\nCaspar: Sure. Anything'll help.\nCatherine: When I told you I would cut down children with no hesitation, you looked disgusted. I take it that's the part you're struggling to accept?\nCaspar: Pretty much. I don't think I'd be able to do it, even if that meant disobeying orders.\nCatherine: Well, what if the children had their own weapons? What if they were trying to kill you?\nCaspar: Maybe if it was in self-defense, but even that --\nCatherine: What if the children were killing each other? Let's say their families had been slaughtered, and they sought revenge. How would you stop the killing? Who would you strike down?\nCaspar: I ... don't know. I'd have to see what's going on for myself, but even then, I ...\nCatherine: When you witness these horrors in person, it's no easier to decide. In fact, the decision is harder. Choosing to end or spare a life ... Whether to save someone or abandon them ... These choices are always difficult.\nCaspar: Having to choose between life and death ...\nCatherine: You have a strong sense of justice. You have clearly defined ideals. But that's not an asset on the battlefield. Ideals slow you down. They cause inner conflict. Making decisions in the spur of the moment, you can't hope to be perfectly fair and just. That's why I chose to fight for Lady Rhea's justice. The justice of the Church of Seiros.\nCaspar: But what about when Lady Rhea's ideals don't really line up with yours? Then what?\nCatherine: Not possible. Lady Rhea's ideals are my ideals. There's no conflict between them, because that's what I've decided. Do you see?\nCaspar: I don't get it. You can't possibly agree on everything!\nCatherine: I have faltered in the past.\nCaspar: That's what I'm talking about! How can you blindly trust some other person's sense of justice?\nCatherine: Not a person. The goddess. I cared about someone, and they were branded a criminal. That's when I started down this path. I didn't know whether to turn a blind eye or mete out punishment.\nCaspar: What did you do?\nCatherine: I couldn't decide. So I looked to the goddess for guidance. Since then, I have devoted myself completely to the goddess. I surrender myself wholly to her will. So think carefully, Caspar. To what will you devote your sword -- and your heart?\nCaspar: ..._Caspar: Hey, Catherine! I wanted to tell you I've decided to do things my own way.\nCatherine: I'm happy for you, Caspar! But I don't know what you're talking about.\nCaspar: Come on -- you know! In life and death situations, like we talked about. I spent a lot of time thinking, but it was tough to figure out ... Then I realized I was wasting my time! I decided I should keep fighting the way that feels right to me!\nCatherine: Hm. I thought that might be your decision.\nCaspar: I've still got something important to ask you though.\nCatherine: Something important, huh? Let's hear it.\nCaspar: Could you ... you know, keep an eye on me?\nCatherine: What? Why?\nCaspar: I may have decided to do things my own way ... But I'm sure I'll still mess up sometimes. I might be able to avoid any real damage if a Knight of Seiros has my back!\nCatherine: I see. Then I refuse.\nCaspar: Great! Thanks so much! I knew you'd -- Wh-what?!\nCatherine: After deciding to take your own path, you ask someone else to watch over you? It's like you can't think for yourself. Your simplemindedness is kind of charming, but still ...\nCaspar: I really thought you'd say yes ... Now what am I supposed to do?\nCatherine: I don't know. I'm not your babysitter. You want someone to watch after you? Become the type of man people can't look away from._Caspar: Hahh ... Yes! I did it! I finally got a hit on you!\nCatherine: Not bad. I didn't expect you to come this far.\nCaspar: Hah! I've been training nonstop, so it had to happen eventually! I've been using my head a lot more too. I'm not the same ol' Caspar!\nCatherine: Then what kind of Caspar are you?\nCaspar: Well, if you're Thunder Catherine, then I get to be ... Lightning Caspar! No, no, th-that's no good. Fiery ... No, no ... Hmm ... Burning Caspar?\nCatherine: I wonder where all this \"fire\" of yours comes from.\nCaspar: It comes from wanting to fight by your side.\nCatherine: Sorry, what?\nCaspar: You said before that you don't want to keep an eye on me. Something about not being my babysitter?\nCatherine: Yes. I seem to recall saying something like that.\nCaspar: That's why I decided I needed to train and get to your level instead! I'm gonna keep getting stronger! That way I'll never have to leave your side! You and me, we're --\nCatherine: Stop. That's enough for now. You've only managed to hit me once. Let's see if you can actually beat me. If that happens, I'll hear your request.\nCaspar: In that case, you'd better get ready! I'm real fired up now! You're gonna have to start calling me ... Inferno Caspar!_A+_null_
7_38_Caspar: Hey, Shamir! Your archery skills were amazing the other day. I couldn't believe it when you hit all those bulls-eyes. Not a single miss!\nShamir: It was nothing.\nCaspar: No way! It was incredible! You were incredible! You gotta teach me how to shoot.\nShamir: Maybe.\nCaspar: That sounds like a \"yes\" to me! Are you free tomorrow?\nShamir: Maybe. No promises though.\nCaspar: Come on, Shamir! Don't be like that! Wait. Is this because you don't think I'm good enough? That can't be it.\nShamir: It's nothing personal. As someone born in Dagda, I'm not very fond of the Empire.\nCaspar: Dagda? Where is— Oh! You mean where they had that war with the Empire a few years back? The country west of Fódlan? Across the ocean. That Dagda?\nShamir: That Dagda. But that is behind us.\nCaspar: I had no idea. I understand why you'd hate the Empire so much though. My father was a major general in that war. He led an entire army. If I were you, I definitely wouldn't want to train the son of someone who killed all those Dagdans...\nShamir: You misunderstand. I harbor no ill will toward your generation.\nCaspar: Huh? Then what does this have to do with you teaching me how to shoot?\nShamir: I simply have other commitments. I don't have the time to teach everyone, so I can't make any promises.\nCaspar: That's your reason? You're just too busy? I thought you hated me. I guess I had nothing to worry about. In that case, I'm excited to get to know you better. Let's leave all that Dagda and Empire stuff in the past.\n[As Caspar says the last sentence, Shamir walks off-screen, only when he finishes does he notice her absence.]_Shamir: Caspar. How have you been?\nCaspar: Oh! Shamir! I've been... normal. Yeah, totally normal. (nervous chuckle)\nShamir: What's wrong?\nCaspar: Nothing's wrong! Everything's normal!\nShamir: Then you should try acting like it. If something is bothering you, you should come out and say it.\nCaspar: I, uhh... I don't know what you're talking about.\nShamir: I'm disappointed, Caspar. I thought you were the type to always speak your mind.\nCaspar: All right! Fine! You got me! Truth is that I heard something about you... I heard you fought in the battle between the Empire and Dagda.\nShamir: Yes. And?\nCaspar: And I heard that you maybe lost someone important in that battle.\nShamir: Perhaps. Your point?\nCaspar: No point! Not trying to make a point! I just didn't know you were involved in all that. I was hoping we could be friends, but you fought against the Empire. You obviously have every reason to hate them, so I'm sure you don't want me around...\nShamir: What does my past have to do with you?\nCaspar: My father was responsible for a lot of what happened to the Dagdans.\nShamir: Are YOU responsible for what happened to the Dagdans?\nCaspar: Well, no... but kinda? I know I wasn't there, but I gotta—\nShamir: Bring them back.\nCaspar: Huh?\nShamir: If you're responsible, then bring back the lives that were lost. If you can't, then spare me your pity.\nCaspar: But—\nShamir: Yesterday's enemy is today's ally. You have to abandon old feuds. Only then can you face me as a friend.\n(Shamir walks off-screen)\nCaspar: Ugh..._Shamir: You fought well in that battle. You've improved.\nCaspar: Hah! I couldn't have done it without you.\nShamir: True.\nCaspar: Wha— Come on! You're supposed to disagree and compliment me instead!\nShamir: Fine. In the past, you were reckless. Lately, you are less so. You are more considerate of your allies, and much easier to fight alongside.\nCaspar: (blushing) Whoa now! Tha— That's enough! Getting compliments from you is... kinda weird. But I get what you mean. I feel safer on the battlefield when you're out there with me too. I always trust that you've got my back. I guess we make a good team!\nShamir: I can't disagree.\nCaspar: Hey, do you remember that time I saved you and almost got myself killed? You were pretty mad. That actually had a big impact on me. After that, I decided I had to be able to save you without getting hurt myself. So I started paying more attention. I read your movements in battle and stayed out of your way. Before I knew it, it was almost like I could read your mind!\nShamir: An interesting concept. We have become a very efficient team, but you will never understand my thoughts.\nCaspar: Not true! I know exactly what you're thinking!\nShamir: Then prove it. What am I thinking right now.\nCaspar: (panics) Right now? Uh, let's see... You, uh, you're thinking that I'm a reliable ally in battle. And you'd like to keep fighting by my side! And you think we're connected! (smug) Yeah, that's right! Even though we come from different places, YOU feel a bond!\nShamir: ...\nCaspar: Sigh... (sweats) That was all just wishful thinking, wasn't it. i guess I'll never know what's actually going on in your head.\nShamir: Wishful thinking?\nCaspar: Huh? (panics) Oh, I probably said too much...\nShamir: You did indeed.\nCaspar: (blushing) If you'll excuse me, I gotta go find a hole to bury my head in.\nShamir: Don't worry; your wishes aren't so far from the truth. Now, shall we be off?\n(Shamir walks off-screen)\nCaspar: Huh? Wh- What do you mean? Shamir, wait! (runs after her)_(sounds of battle)\nShamir: Leave this to me! Go!\nCaspar: Shamir! Look out! Auugh!\nShamir: Caspar! Are you all right? Talk to me!\n(scene changes to monastery infirmary)\nCaspar: (sits up in bed) Ahh! Shamir!\nShamir: Lower your voice. I'm right here.\nCaspar: Look out! The enemy's right— Huh? We're in the infirmary?\nShamir: Correct. It took you a while to wake up. (glare) You nearly died protecting me. Why did you do something so reckless?\nCaspar: Well, I saw that you were in trouble and—\nShamir: Is this your attempt to take responsibility for your father's actions? I don't need your pity, Caspar.\nCaspar: Wait a minute! I do feel guilty for what my father did to the Dagdans... But this has nothing to do with that! I saw your were in danger, and my body moved before I could even think about it! That's all!\nShamir: You are still a fool. Learn to protect yourself before trying to protect me. There's no point in losing one life to save another. Yours holds just as much value as mine.\nCaspar: I understand what you're saying, but—\nShamir: However, I cannot deny that I owe you a debt. Thank you, Caspar. And... (looks down) I apologize.\nCaspar: Um... For what? You didn't do anything.\nShamir: For when we spoke before. I... may have been too harsh. I cannot hold a grudge against someone who would risk his life for mine. That said, you need not worry about me.\nCaspar: Uh, yeah. Glad to hear it. But I gotta say, not worrying about you is a lot easier said than done._B+_null_
