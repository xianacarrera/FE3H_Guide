11_41_Cyril: Aha! Found ya! You're always nosing around places, aren't ya, Professor? Can be real hard to find ya sometimes!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sorry about that.\nChoice 2: Is something the matter?\nCyril:\nChoice 1 response: No worrying about it! I just wanted to talk to ya about a thing today.\nChoice 2 response: Well, yeah, I wouldn't have been running all over the place looking for you if stuff was normal.\nCyril: Do you remember how Lady Rhea asked you to come to the office this evening? Well, she told me that I should come to let ya know that today's a bad day for doing that, and you should go and see her tomorrow instead. That's pretty much everything I needed to say, I think... Oh! Except to ask you if you've seen Seteth around anywhere.\nByleth: I haven't, sorry.\nCyril: Ugh, OK. I'm supposed to tell Seteth the thing Lady Rhea told me to tell you, but he's hard to find.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Want me to tell him for you?\nChoice 2: Want to look for him together?\nCyril:\nChoice 1 response: Nah, I'll find him myself.\nChoice 2 response: Nah, it's all right, thanks.\nCyril: But if ya see him, then find me, please, and tell me where ya saw him, OK? 'Cause then I'll know where he is. I'll be in the stables if ya need me. Gotta put out the fodder before it's the next kid's shift. Don't want her thinking I left my work for her to do. Oh! But if I'm not in the stables, and ya need to find me, I'll be at the forest up north 'cause there's a buncha logs lying around up there. I figure I oughta chop 'em up or else someone might trip on a log, or we might run out of firewood. And if I chop it, then it'll save other people time. If it looks like I'm done there, then the corridors need to be sweeped, so if ya see Seteth and ya need to find me, then I might be there...\nByleth: Can I help you with anything?\nCyril: Nope. This is my job. I'm not giving it to anyone else, because it's mine and I'm gonna do it. Besides, if ya help me out, Lady Rhea might gimme an earful. I don't know why, but Lady Rhea sure does seem to like ya. She's always worried about what ya might be doing or not doing...\nByleth: Is that so?\nCyril: Oh yeah. Not that it's any of my business. Anyways, Lady Rhea asked me to do some jobs, so I'm doing 'em all. Even some she didn't ask for, but I know need doing, so I'm doing 'em. End of story. And remember, if you see Seteth around, come find me and tell me where you saw him, yeah?\nByleth: Seems like it'll be tough to find you...\nCyril: Huh? But I just told ya where I'd be. If I'm not in the stables, I'll be at the forest. If I'm not... Oh, I see. You're right. I'm all over the place, huh? I don't wanna waste your time, Professor, so if ya see Seteth, how about ya tell him I was looking for him and then tell him all the places I'll be. Then he can spend his time looking for me instead of you. Yeah! That sounds like a good plan. A real good plan. Let's do that! See ya later, Professor.\nByleth: ..._Cyril: ♪ Keeping it clean... Sweeping it clean... No more trash... Nowhere, no how... ♪ Oh darn. There's trash over there.\n(Byleth enters)\n\nByleth: Hard at work, I see,\nCyril: Hey, Professor! The cathedral's a real important place for the Church of Seiros, so I always make sure it's all sparkling clean. The monks do some cleaning too, and they all tell me not to bother—and sometimes they even say to go away—but they just don't clean as good as I do. I don't stop until everything shines.\nByleth: Are you a believer?\nCyril: Nah, not really. And Lady Rhea told me it's OK if I don't show an interest unless I feel like it, and I haven't so far, but... I just want to take good care of the things she cares about. If there's a thing she wants taken care of, then I'll do it better than anyone else. Whaddaya think? You’d go the extra mile for Lady Rhea, wouldn’t ya?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I wouldn't go that far...\nChoice 2: It's hard to find the time...\nCyril: Maybe you don't realize how great of a person Lady Rhea is. She's always praying hard as she can for her followers all across Fódlan. She does it every single day! And even though she's always so busy, she tries to listen to as many people's needs as she can. When she'd seen the kids who'd lost their parents in Remire Village, she didn't leave 'em there. She got the church to take those kids in. Same as me. She's so kind. She's almost like a mom to all her followers, and just about everybody that I can think of loves her.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Is that so?\nChoice 2: I think it's about more than kindness.\nCyril:\nChoice 1 response: You really didn't know?\nChoice 2 response: Hang on! You trying to say that ya know more about Lady Rhea than I do?\nCyril: OK, maybe she likes ya more than she likes me... But I know that I know a whole lot more about her than you do. I know these things, OK? So don't go talking down to me like ya know better.\nByleth: I wasn't, though...\nCyril: Huh? Well, just as long as we're all clear on that._Cyril: Phew! Time for a breather.\n(Byleth enters)\n\nCyril: Hey, Professor.\nByleth: You've been busy.\nCyril: Yup. Noticed you have been too. Seems like it's been a real rough day for just about everybody, huh? I've been so busy I still haven't eaten. I hope there's still food left.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Here, have some candy.\nChoice 2: Here, have some meat.\nCyril:\nChoice 1 response: Whoa! Thanks, Professor! Mmm-mm... This is really good!\nChoice 2 response: How come you're carrying that around? Whatever. I'm hungry! Mmm-mm... When you're hungry enough, just about anything tastes good.\nCyril: What a day... I need a nap, but I still gotta get the dining hall cleaned up.\nByleth: You shouldn't push yourself too hard.\nCyril: Huh, Professor, that's funny. You push yourself harder than anybody else. Ya make me look lazy! Besides, I don't even break a sweat doing this stuff. The day Lady Rhea comes home, I want her to see the monastery the way it was five years ago. That's why I do all this stuff—for her. And the harder I work, the better. Heck, I'd do more than I do now if there were hours in the day, but I can't go without sleep. Tried once. You must think I'm pretty weird, huh, Professor? I'm always on about Lady Rhea, and I'm not even from Fódlan. I bet most people around here think I'm kinda weird. But I'm real grateful for everything Lady Rhea's done for me.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's noble of you to show such gratitude.\nChoice 2: I don't think it's wrong to live for another.\nCyril: That's nice of you to say. Real nice. Thanks, Professor. It's good to know you like me. Helps me feel even more at home. I've heard people say that good folks have a heart of gold. Not real gold, I mean. Just, they always care about everybody else. Even guys like me. Lady Rhea's incredible, but I figure you're just the same, Professor. OK. I guess I gotta give in and get some sleep. I'll get up extra early to make up for it. Good night, Professor…_null_null_null_

I've been so busy, I haven't had much time for that lately. I don't know what to do now, anyway... With Lady Rhea gone, I feel like there's not much point in me being here anymore.\nByleth: What do you want to do?\nCyril: I don't know. Up till now, she's all I've been living for. That's the way it's always been, so I don't have any good ideas about what I oughta do next. I've got nowhere else to go. Not even back to Almyra.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Why don't you stay here?\nChoice 2: You could go on a journey.\nCyril:\nChoice 1 response: What am I supposed to do here?

Huh... I don't know. Only thing I ever wanted was to serve Lady Rhea. I guess that's what I want. Someone I can help. I don't think I can live my life just for me. Do you think maybe, from now on... I mean, if you'd be OK with it, I could...\nByleth: I want you to have this.\nCyril: A ring?\nByleth: Try it on.\nCyril: O-OK... It's a real snug fit. But why are you giving me this?\nByleth: There's no running away now.\nCyril: No running aw— Is this a cursed ring?! If I run away, I'll die?! Why would you— Oh, so I can't leave this place... You...really want me to stay that badly?\n(Byleth nods)\n\nCyril: Ya know what? I'm happy to stay! I'll work real hard and be super useful to you! I think it's kinda who I am, living like this, being real useful to other folks. Besides, I'll die if I try to leave, right?\n(Byleth nods)\n\nCyril: Actually, this ring could come off pretty easy.\nByleth: You want to take it off?\nCyril: Nah, it gives me a reason to stay. That's the whole point, right? Heh, whether we stay or go, I'm stickin' with you. I've gone and fallen in love, ya know. To be honest, since the first day you showed up, I always did like ya. Think I can get a good night's sleep now, knowing I'll still be here tomorrow... I'm gonna head to bed. Sleep tight. Love ya! See ya in the morning!
11_34_Cyril: …\n(Petra enters)\n\nPetra: Cyril. You are always having great passion and hard work. You give inspiration!\nCyril: Aw, just doing my job.\nPetra: There is no need for showing humility. You work with hardness… I mean, you work hard. It makes me have curiosity. Can you tell me what plans you hold for the future?\nCyril: The future? I don’t know anything about the future, but I’m kinda busy, so can we talk later?\nPetra: I have had the learning that you are from Almyra. Everyone has the saying that it may have…may be hard to move up in the church for you. But even with that, you always have passion and work with hardness! What fills you with determination?\nCyril: I work because I work. It’s what I do here. And, ya know, I really wanna make myself useful to Lady Rhea, so I can repay the big debt I owe her. Lady Rhea gave me a home when I didn’t have one.\nPetra: I understand the feeling of need for repaying debts. But does it give you difficulty, being a great distance from your home for so much time?\nCyril: Almyra’s just where I was born. It’s not like I’ve got family there. If ya love your homeland and wanna go back, then that’s nice, but…it’s not a thing I wanna do. I like where I am. The best future I can think of…is if things stayed like this forever.\nPetra: Yes. I have understanding. You and I…have similarities. But, at the similar time, we have differences.\nCyril: Maybe. Hey, I still got a lot of work. Better get to it.\n(Cyril leaves)\n\nPetra: Cyril…does not want to speak about his land of home? It gives me curiosity…_Cyril: Petra… What’re ya doing?\nPetra: Hello, Cyril! I was doing training for hunting.\nCyril: I thought you were already a good hunter.\nPetra: I am good, but to keep good, I must keep practicing.\nCyril: Oh, I get it. Huh. Hey, can I ask you a question? I mean, I figure you asked me a personal question before, so now it’s my turn. That is, if ya don’t mind. Tell me why it is you do all this training and if it’s got something to do with where you’re from.\nPetra: My training and my land of home… Before I can give answers, I must give you my history. I was a child in Brigid. But then there happened the war with the Empire. My parents were…they died. Brigid lost in the war. After it, a decision was had that I must go to the Empire.\nCyril: War, huh? That’s the same as me.\nPetra: Yes. But our difference is that I still have a strong devotion to my land of home. I want to grow my skills and train with hardness for the goodness of my land of home. I will one day be leading Brigid. I want to have better relations with Fódlan. So, that is why I am here when I wish I could be there.\nCyril: Oh, wow. You do all this so maybe you can be a leader for your people? I guess I was right. You’re real different than me.\nPetra: We have differences, but we do not have so many differences. You and I are the same, I believe.\nCyril: The same?\nPetra: You work with great passion. All for the future and…to keep protected what is here today. I work for the future of my land of home. You are the same, but here is your home.\nCyril: Hmm… I don’t know. Maybe, but… I guess that does mean I’m putting in a lot of effort every day, just like you.\nPetra: That is what I have said. You and I are the same, even with the differences we have._Petra: Cyril. How is your bow training progressing?\nCyril: I think maybe I’ve gotten better. It feels a lot easier to ready the bow lately.\nPetra: That is a nice thing to be hearing! You have my support with your efforts.\nCyril: I do?\nPetra: Yes. I am always cheering you on. I am long feeling a great affinity with you. Our positions are dissimilar, but our situations have great similarities. That is why I am always trying hard to be supporting and protecting you.\nCyril: You mean, you’ve been cheering me on all along? That’s nice to hear. Well, in that case, I’ll support you too!\nPetra: You will? That gives me great joy!\nCyril: It makes you happy? It’s gonna sound funny, but hearing you say that makes me feel happy too. Ya know, I just realized that there’s… Well, when you talk, it’s kinda powerful. It’s like…everything ya say feels real nice and reassuring. Just listening to you makes me feel better about everything. I think it’s a special talent you have.\nPetra: Words can be said by anyone. Alone, they are without power. What is meaningful is…how you are feeling. I am hoping I can learn to use words well, to convey my feelings. That is my wish. I am still learning… My words are not coming out as properly as I am wanting.\nCyril: Maybe the words aren’t, but the feelings behind ‘em are. I really do think you’re special. Now that I know you’re supporting me, I’m going to work real hard not to let ya down. And, um… I hope someday I can get strong enough to inspire you the same way you inspire me.\nPetra: You have already been achieving that goal. You already have great strength.\nCyril: You really think so? Nah, I still got a long way to go. I’m not tough enough to match you yet. So I’m gonna get stronger. Stronger and stronger, so I can support you forever.\nPetra: Stronger and stronger? So you can be supporting me forever?\nCyril: Yeah. Forever and ever.\nPetra: Even when I am being an old woman? It will be a difficulty then. Hehehe!\nCyril: Sure, even when you’re an old woman, I’ll be an old man, right beside ya, doing my best.\nPetra: (she bows) Old woman Petra and old man Cyril, supporting each other. I am looking forward to it!\nCyril: Heh… Yeah, that does sound nice. (he bows)_null_null_null_
11_33_Cyril: Zzz...\nMercedes: What's this? Well, if it isn’t Cyril! How did he manage to fall asleep here? The warmth must have put him right down. He looks so cute when he’s napping.\nCyril: Zzz...\nMercedes: I'll just keep reading. No need to disturb him...\nCyril: ...\nMercedes: Good morning, Cyril. Did you sleep well?\nCyril: What? Where? Mer-M-Mer...\nMercedes:\n(Part I): It’s Mercedes. I hope you’ll commit my name to memory.\n(Part II): It's Mercedes. I thought you'd remember my name by now.\nCyril: Oh, sorry. I know it, but it’s hard to say.\nMercedes: You’re from Almyra, aren’t you? I hope you haven’t been uncomfortable here at the academy.\nCyril: Nah, it’s great. I eat every day!\nMercedes: Were you not eating before you came here?\nCyril: Every couple days, maybe. It was rough.\nMercedes: Oh, I’m so sorry to hear that. Are you hungry?\nCyril: Um...\nMercedes: You should eat up. To make up for all the meals you missed in the past!\nCyril: Heh, OK. Thank you, Merm... Mammal... Mar...\nMercedes: Just call me Mercie. That’s what my friends call me.\nCyril: Mer...cie. Mercie. Hey! Thanks, Mercie. Welp, I had a good sleep, but there’s work to do, now. See ya!\nMercedes: It doesn’t seem like he has very many friends here... It’s troubling, but I probably shouldn’t pry._Cyril: Zzz... Zzz...\nMercedes: Did Cyril fall asleep here again? Hmm. There's nothing to cover him with. He'll catch cold if he's here too long. Oh well, I guess I have no other options. I'll have to take care of this myself.\nCyril: Aah! What?! Wh-what's happening?!\nMercedes: I'm keeping you warm so you don't catch cold. Um, I'm sorry. Did I make you uncomfortable?\nCyril: I...I was just surprised. Th-thanks, Mercie.\nMercedes: Oh! I'm happy to hear you call me that! You know, I seem to find you in here pretty often. Do you have a favorite book?\nCyril: Nah, but it's always real quiet here, so it's where I like to sleep.\nMercedes: I see. You always seem so wrapped up in your work. That is, whenever you're not sleeping in the library. Do you have many friends here?\nCyril: No, not really.\nMercedes: But don't you want some? Having friends is much more fun than spending all of your time alone.\nCyril: Nah, I don't want people treating me like an outsider. I'm better off alone.\nMercedes: An outsider? You? Who would possibly say—\nCyril: Oh. So you don't think anyone thinks that? Should I tell you what happened to me before I came here?\nMercedes: Oh, no. You really don't have to. I didn't mean to bring up such difficult memories. But you know... Everyone here sees you as a friend. Even me. I see you as a good friend.\nCyril: Mercie... I'm sorry. I sure like everyone here too, but... It feels like you're, I don't know... It sounds weird maybe, but I think you're something different than a friend.\nMercedes: Different? In what way? Do you not like me?\nCyril: No, it's not that. I can't... Ya know how sometimes you can't explain things? This is that. If I had a sister, I think that might be how it feels being around you.\nMercedes: Really? That's just as well! You remind me of my little brother!\nCyril: Oh, you got a brother?\nMercedes: I do, but I haven't seen him in so long. It's almost like he's not really my brother anymore... But you can count on me if you need anything at all. I'll do my best to help you out.\nCyril: I can count on you for anything? Wow..._null_null_null_null_
11_24_Cyril: Ignatz? Why ya following me?\nIgnatz: Oh, I... Can I help you with something? You must be struggling by yourself, Cyril!\nCyril: This is my job. I do it myself.\nIgnatz: But we could do it so much faster working together!\nCyril: Ya don't have to.\nIgnatz: I don't mind. Plus, if we finish early, you can go and do whatever you like.\nCyril: You wanna know what I wanna do?\nIgnatz: Sure! Tell me.\nCyril: I'd like to do my assigned work without you pestering me.\nIgnatz: Oh... Ok.\nCyril: Why are you always so concerned about what I'm doing anyway, Ignatz? It's kinda weird, ya know?\nIgnatz: Wow, it hurts when you put it like that. I've been meaning to ask you about Almyra. You always look so busy, but I thought you might talk to me if I helped you with your work.\nCyril: There's nothing about Almyra worth talking about.\nIgnatz: But I find it all so fascinating! Please, tell me about the people, the buildings, the flowers... Ooh! Any scenery you liked looking at?\nCyril: Nope. Never took much time to look at anything. Why do I gotta talk about stuff I don't wanna talk about just because you're bored, Ignatz?\nIgnatz: Even though you endured hardships, there must have been some things you enjoyed.\nCyril: You don't get it. Look, I'm gonna go. Shoulda done it already.\nIgnatz: Ok. Sorry to bother you. Let me know if I can help. Oh, and... I hope we can talk some other time.\nCyril: But there's nothing to talk about. Jeez, what a weirdo._Cyril: Hey, Ignatz? Whatcha doing?\nIgnatz: Cyril, hello. I was just looking outside. Are you off to work right now?\nCyril: I'm gonna get a bucket and get rid of that big puddle everybody keeps walking around.\nIgnatz: Oh, you're going to get rid of the puddle over there? That's a shame.\nCyril: Huh?\nIgnatz: I've quite enjoyed looking at the puddle. But pay me no mind. The work needs doing, I know.\nCyril: I... Huh? What's so nice about it?\nIgnatz: Well, look at it. With the addition of the puddle, the whole landscape has changed dramatically. Plus, it's perfectly unique. No two puddles are alike. Light will never again hit the water in quite the same way. This whole landscape is unique, in fact. Here, now, for us to enjoy. It didn't exist a moment ago, and it won't exist in a moment.\nCyril: I guess you're right, huh? Weird. I never thought of rain that way. How the world makes look different and how that's kinda special, I mean.\nIgnatz: Your mood just brightened, Cyril. And that made the world a little brighter, didn't it? That's the other thing about looking at a landscape. The view is affected by the viewer's feelings.\nCyril: Huh... Maybe you're right. When I remember it, I think Almyra was a real dull and lonely place. Once you're outta the city, there's nothing but the plains and sky, and they stretch on forever. You can lose yourself out there. That's the kind of place it is. It's strange, when I remember it now, even thought it's lonely, it also seems real pretty too.\nIgnatz: Maybe the image in your memories is affected by your emotional state. Anyway, it sounds fascinating. Endless plains, boundless sky. That's Almyra, huh? The thought makes my pulse quicken.\nCyril: Heh, you're a big weirdo, Ignatz.\nIgnatz: Am I? Heh, I suppose I am.\nCyril: Sitting around, talking about how pretty puddles are?\nIgnatz: Well, when you put it like that! Still, I'd love to see Almyra some day. Cyril, after the war, would you go there with me? We can make some memories of your homeland that aren't all dull and lonely!\nCyril: I don't know. Maybe. But, yeah. I'll think about it._null_null_null_null_
11_30_Cyril: Hmm, this one oughta do.\nLysithea: Uh, what are you doing, Cyril?\nCyril: I'm picking out logs to carry back and chop into firewood.\nLysithea: You can't expect to carry all these by yourself. Let me help.\nCyril: Nah, I got it. I don't want ya getting hurt. Logs are heavy sometimes.\nLysithea: I'm well aware. You should accept the help being offered. I'm older and wiser— I know best.\nCyril: Um, Lysithea, ya seem a but shaky. You OK?\nLysithea: Yep, totally fine. I'm just kinda losing my grip on this log. Agh! Well, that wasn't much help. as it turned out. I didn't realize they'd be that heavy. Couldn't even walk in a straight line...\nCyril: I told ya, logs are heavy sometimes. It's hard work if you're not used to it.\nLysithea: I feel foolish.\nCyril: Well, if you've learned your lesson, I'm gonna go carry the older logs.\nLysithea: Hang on— shouldn't you rest for a bit?\nCyril: Wood still needs chopping. I got a buncha other stiff needs doing before sundown too.\nLysithea: In that case, let me help you carry the chopped wood!\nCyril: You know how rough firewood is? You'll get splinters if ya carry it with your soft hands.\nLysithea: You can't be serious!\nCyril: You're just not cut out for this kinda work. Look at your hands, they're like a princess's. No point in you learning to chop wood, is there? You don't need to know how to do that stuff. You and me live in different worlds. There's no point lowering yourself down into mine.\nLysithea: Our worlds aren't so different. We're together right now, aren't we?\nCyril: Sure, we live in the same places now, but that's not gonna last forever. Don't see how it could, unless I actually turned into your little brother or something._(Imperial soldier hands Cyril something. Screen fades to black, then back in. Cyril is now alone in the Dining Hall)\n\nCyril: …\n(Lysithea enters)\n\nLysithea: Hey, Cyril! Cyril? Hmm. What is he staring at? I see... Hey, what are you looking at there? Anything interesting? Let me have a look.\n(Cyril hands over the piece of paper he had in his hands to Lysithea.)\n\nLysithea: \"3 apples, 2 bags of ointment, 1 piece of graphite.\" Intriguing... Some sort of code, perhaps?\nCyril: Nah, I was just asked to go out and buy the stuff on this list.\nLysithea: Oh, that's all? Sorry for interrupting, in that case. This is kind of a one-person job, so I won't bother you by offering aid.\nCyril: You actually helped a lot just now, reading that list for me like you did. I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't tell anybody, 'cause I've been trying to keep it a secret, but... I don't know how to read, so I wasn't sure what to do with the list.\nLysithea: Is that so? But why do you keep it a secret?\nCyril: I'd hate it if people figured I wasn't up to a job just 'cause I couldn't read.\nLysithea: You're always welcome to call on me for help. I'd be happy to.\nCyril: Thanks, I will.\nLysithea: I really mean that. Anything you need.\nCyril: OK.\nLysithea: Good! Now, you'd better go get those supplies before it gets dark. Do you remember everything on the list? Need me to read it one more time for you?\nCyril: That would be pretty helpful, actually.\nLysithea: All right, listen up! I'm not gonna do this a third time!\n(Lysithea repeats the list once more before leaving.)\n\nCyril: Lysithea's not a good liar, is she? She knew I was in trouble right away. Hang on. Did she just wanna act like a big sister again? But she looked real happy when she was helping me. And I think I'd like to see that smile again sometime._Cyril: Hey, Lysithea. I'm glad I found ya.\nLysithea: What's up, Cyril?\nCyril: Could you read something for me again?\nLysithea: Looks like it's another shopping list. I'm happy to help you out. Did you try looking it over yourself yet?\nCyril: What's the use? I told ya I can't read.\nLysithea: Have a look here—any of these letters look familiar?\nCyril: Huh? This one? Was that...apples? So it says...three...apples?\nLysithea: Yes, you got it! See? You can do it!\nCyril: I wonder if there's anything else I can recognize! Let's see...\nLysithea: It's clear you've got a sharp memory. If you apply yourself, you'll be reading in no time. Reading is such an important skill. Once you learn, you won't forget! And I won't be around to read things for you forever.\nCyril: Lysithea?\nLysithea: Anyway, don't you enjoy learning? It seems like you haven't even thought of trying prior to this. Do you simply not have time for it?\nCyril: Until now, I never thought about how to learn, and since I was hiding it, I never asked anybody. But right now, I feel like I'd be happy to live like this for a little bit longer.\nLysithea: It seems like a hassle at this point not to learn, so you may as well start putting in the work!\nCyril: Well, I like having you read things to me.\nLysithea: You do?\nCyril: Yeah, you always seem happy when I ask you to read things, and when you're happy, you smile. I think you're pretty when you smile. I betcha everyone tells you that though, huh?\nLysithea: As a matter of fact, they haven't! Stop messing with me!\nCyril: Hang on a second. Am I the only one who's seen you make that face? Is that why nobody's told you?\nLysithea: Excuse you! I mean, honestly!\nCyril: OK, well, I'm gonna go take care of this errand for the professor. I'll see you later, Lysithea.\nLysithea: Don't expect me to read for you again! And, uh...just take care of yourself, will you?_(Cyril talks to himself)\n\nCyril: I did it! I did it! OK, so next up is...\n(Lysithea later reads a letter to herself)\n\nLysithea: What's this letter all about... Doesn't appear to have a sender written anywhere... This hand writing is so sloppy. Wow. \"Dear Lysithea, I read the book you gave me.\" This must be from Cyril! He's learning so quickly! \"It was hard. And it got more easy more I tried it. And it was fun. And I learned new stuff.\" That's the spirit! \"Thanks you for helping me to read and to write.\" You are so welcome. \"Somethings are hard to say and easy to write.\" I know just what you mean. \"I want to read more and learn writing better.\" You're already doing so well with this. I can see how hard you're working! \"I am glad you are my friend. It makes me bappy.\"\nLysithea: ...\n(Cyril knocks on the door, and enters)\n\nCyril: Hey, Lysithea! Last night I finished reading the book you lent me. I wanted to tell you right away, but it was late, so I tried to write a letter... Um, Lysithea?\nLysithea: Cyril! You sweet, little—\nCyril: Did I do something wrong? I don't know what you're trying to say.\nLysithea: Some feelings can't be verbalized or put into writing. Just... Look, it's just that... I...\nCyril: I'm sorry. I really don't know what you're trying to say.\nLysithea: What I'm trying to say is, \"I'm bappy too.\"\nCyril: B...bappy?\nLysithea: Let's keep studying and spending time together, OK?\nCyril: Oh! I get ya now. That sounds great, Lysithea._A+_null_
11_22_Hilda: Hey, Cyril. What're you up to? Working?\nCyril: You're in the way, Hilda. Move.\nHilda: How rude! I'm not in the way.\nCyril: Are you just here to goof off?\nHilda: No. I'm here to feed the horses, actually.\nCyril: Uh-huh. Where's the fodder then?\nHilda: I wasn't sure where to find it. Can you help with that?\nCyril: I'll take care of it. I'm cleaning the place anyways.\nHilda: Ooh, thanks! It's great to have you on the job. I know you'll handle it perfectly.\nCyril: Yeah, well, I don't like it when I feel like I'm not doing my part.\nHilda: You're always so focused on the task at hand. Sometimes, I almost forget you're Almyran. I always thought they were a...rough and unreliable sort of people. Though you're not really like the rest of them. You seem normal for the most part.\nCyril: Rough and unreliable, huh?\nHilda: My family has to fight against Almyrans sometimes. Not that my father or brother ever clued me in on what the battles were like. But I do know that armies from Almyra will attack without reason, and break treaties, and tell lies... Everyone says they're a bunch of brutes.\nCyril: Yeah? Huh.\nHilda: Am I boring you? I'm talking about your people.\nCyril: Those aren't my people. I was just born there.\nHilda: Hm. OK, let's turn the tables. How do the people of Fódlan seem to you, from an Almyran perspective?\nCyril: Huh...\nHilda: That look on your face. Are you OK?\nCyril: I can't tell you what I think of folks from Fódlan. I don't really got an impression of them altogether.\nHilda: What's that supposed to mean?\nCyril: There's all sortsa different people everywhere. You can't say everybody of one place is any one thing. It's no different when you're talking about Fódlan or Almyra or anyplace else. And wherever you go, you see people in power keep the weak ones down._Hilda: Ah, Cyril. Cleaning again, I see.\nCyril: Hilda! You're in the way. Move it.\nHilda: I'm supposed to refill the horses' water troughs, but I can't find the buckets. I was told that they'd be in the \"usual place.\" What's the \"usual place\"?\nCyril: Maybe you'd know where that is if you did your job sometime.\nHilda: You know, Cyril, I don't want to interrupt you while you're cleaning, but—\nCyril: Come on. The buckets are over near the wall...where they always are...because I put them there.\nHilda: OK.\n(Screen fades to black then fades back in)\n\nHilda: Thanks for your help! You're pretty strong. I bet you're tired though. Come on, let's rest a bit.\nCyril: OK. Just for a minute though. I got more work to do.\nHilda: ...\nCyril: ...\nHilda: I'm not a fan of awkward silences. Anything interesting happen lately?\nCyril: Figured you were the one with something to say. Quiet don't bother me.\nHilda: I need an interesting topic for this letter I'm writing to my brother. I'm stumped.\nCyril: Your brother write to you a lot?\nHilda: Constantly, yeah. He must be bored. He's always going on about how worried he is for me. What's worse, if I take too long to reply, he gets more worried and writes more about it!\nCyril: Write about your life, maybe. Ya know, stuff like, \"I got real lazy again today.\" Or maybe, \"Can you believe I still don't know where they put the water buckets?\"\nHilda: You're mean. Do you really think that little of me?\nCyril: You're a lazy gal who gets people to do her work for her. I never knew anybody like that in Almyra.\nHilda: Oh, really? So, Lady Rhea isn't the only difference between Fódlan and Almyra after all?\nCyril: I don't like comparing Lady Rhea with you, but I figure you're right. But you know what's real weird? Nobody seems to mind picking up your slack. Even me...\nHilda: Sorry, what was that?\nCyril: Nothing worth repeating. Anyway, I gotta get back to work.\n(Cyril leaves)\n\nHilda: He's such a diligent boy. I don't think I've ever seen someone from Fódlan work that hard. Oh, hang on! I never got an idea from him about what to write in my letter! Ugh, I guess there's nothing for it. Maybe I can just write about Cyril..._Hilda: Hi, Cyril! Starting to clean, huh?\nCyril: Hilda...\nHilda: Personally, I'm all worn out from carrying water and fodder for the horses. I'm gonna rest here for a sec.\nCyril: Whoa... Tired? Water? Horses? Are you saying you did work all by yourself?\nHilda: What else was I supposed to do? You weren't here to help.\nCyril: OK, I get it. You did the work 'cause you couldn't find nobody else to do it for ya.\nHilda: I was waiting for you! Because, look.\n(Image of a letter is shown on screen)\n\nCyril: A letter?\nHilda: I told you I'm always getting letters from my brother. I wrote about you in a couple of mine.\nCyril: You're talking about me behind my back? Honestly, you're so—\nHilda: We didn't say anything bad! In fact, I... Well, listen up. Here's what my brother wrote.\n(Letter is shown again)\n\nHilda: \"Be he Almyran or no, any young man with compassion and good conduct is worthy of respect. Character is what really matters, not the place of one's birth.\"\nCyril: Huh, that's pretty nice. Especially since it was from a noble who battles Almyrans.\nHilda: Right? He's a funny one, but for the first time, I really respect him. So thoughtful and tolerant.\nCyril: That letter makes me happy. A lot of people look down on me just 'cause I'm Almyran. So ya know, it's nice to hear somebody accept me as just another person.\nHilda: Hey, what's that supposed to mean? I've accepted you from the start! I mean, you're so helpful! You do everything I ask!\nCyril: That's not acceptance. That's relying on somebody else to do your work. What you oughta do is be a grown-up who your brother doesn't need to worry about so much.\nHilda: I'm plenty grown up! I just brought food and water for the horses, all on my own.\nCyril: Being proud of what you're supposed to be doing just means you're lazy the rest of the time. Though, I gotta admit...being relied on is kinda nice.\nHilda: In that case, from now on, I'll rely on you even more! Let's see, first I need you to—\nCyril: Well, time to get back to work.\n(Cyril leaves)\n\nHilda: Hey, hold up!\n(Hilda runs after him)_null_null_null_
11_37_Cyril: Hey, Seteth. I got a delivery for you.\nSeteth: Thank you, Cyril. Would you mind waiting just a moment for me to confirm the contents?\nCyril: Sure thing.\nSeteth: All seems to be accounted for. I lack the time to handle tasks of this kind myself. I appreciate you making the effort. Is there anything I can assist you with? Do you have any concerns?\nCyril: Concerns? Nah, I'm happy just working for Lady Rhea. I got a way better life now than I ever did before.\nSeteth: If your better life is this frugal, I have to wonder what your previous experience was like. It must not have been easy before you came to us. But you should know that is in the past now. You are young. You should be enjoying life. Do not allow your past to overshadow that. Is there nothing you desire? We will support you in any way we can.\nCyril: Really, there's nothing... Except... Nah, it's OK.\nSeteth: Except?\nCyril: I don't got anywhere else to go, and I just wanna be able to stay here forever. This place Lady Rhea gave me, it's the only place I know to call home.\nSeteth: I will keep that in mind.\nCyril: Well, I got work to do. Excuse me.\nSeteth: Of course. I apologize for delaying you._Seteth: Hello, Cyril. On a break?\nCyril: Just figuring out what needs doing next. Why, you need something done?\nSeteth: Nothing like that. I was hoping to speak with you.\nCyril: You wanna talk?\nSeteth: Yes. You told me that you are happy so long as you can continue to work for the archbishop. Have you considered that there might be other ways to find happiness?\nCyril: Nope. Repaying my debt to Lady Rhea is all I want to do. Lady Rhea might not be around right now, but all the stuff I do? It's still for her.\nSeteth: What will you do once your debt is repaid?\nCyril: I can never repay her.\nSeteth: You are possessed of a rare and admirable devotion. I, too, owe the archbishop a debt. But repaying her is only one of the reasons I am here.\nCyril: Whatcha mean \"one of the reasons\" you're here?\nSeteth: I mean that I have other motivations aside from that. If those motivations required me to be elsewhere, then I would be elsewhere.\nCyril: Motivations?\nSeteth: Yes. I am fortunate enough to share common cause with the archbishop. Thus am I able to remain. Don't be mistaken—it is admirable to repay one's debts. But that alone should not define a person. While it is good to make peace with the past, it is also essential to look ahead to the future. What kind of future do you see for yourself? What can you do to work toward it? I would like you to think about what might make your future brighter.\nCyril: I don't know if I understand you right. See, when Lady Rhea took me in, it was the first time I ever thought maybe I had a purpose. And I don't know what else I could wish for than that, ya know?\nSeteth: Hmm... I do not mean to trouble you. It's just that I cannot help but notice the way you squander your potential. It's as though you avert your gaze from it on purpose. Keep what I've said in the back of your mind, at least. You have plenty of time.\nCyril: OK, Seteth._Seteth: Cyril.\nCyril: Hey...\nSeteth: You seem pensive. Have you been thinking over the advice I gave you?\nCyril: Yeah... But it kinda scares me.\nSeteth: Scares you? Why?\nCyril: If I found something else I was more interested in than repaying Lady Rhea... I don't know. Wouldn't that be kinda like I was betraying Lady Rhea? In a way?\nSeteth: Betrayal is a rather strong word, don't you think?\nCyril: Well, I mean, Lady Rhea is why I got this life...or any life. If I ended up just leaving her... That just seems real ungrateful and kinda rude.\nSeteth: If Rhea herself felt betrayed by your actions, then yes, I suppose it would be. But if all you are doing is seeking your path, with no harm to her, I do not think she would object. In fact, I am confident she would be happy for you.\nCyril: You are?\nSeteth: Absolutely. If you continue to devote your whole life purely to repaying your debt, I think she will worry. Ask her yourself when she returns. You will see. You want to make Rhea happy, don't you?\nCyril: Well, yeah. Of course.\nSeteth: Then you should do what makes you happy.\nCyril: OK, I get that, yeah. By the way, there's something weird I noticed.\nSeteth: What is that?\nCyril: Before, whenever we'd talk, you always used to call Lady Rhea \"the archbishop,\" but just now... Just now, you were calling her \"Rhea.\"\nSeteth: Does it perturb you to hear me speak of her with such familiarity?\nCyril: No, I just wondered why.\nSeteth: I am, of course, Rhea's servant. So, in a more formal context, I must maintain a deferential distance. But she and I are actually very old friends. In fact, we think of one another almost like family. I know Rhea extremely well. When I am confident about how she will feel, I am seldom wrong. So trust me when I say that if your path to happiness takes you away from here, she will wish you the best.\nCyril: OK. I'm glad to hear it. Thank you.\nSeteth: Of course, we must first rescue her from her current predicament. I will be counting on your aid in that.\nCyril: You got it._null_null_null_
11_31_Manuela: This is unbelievable! Why? Why does it keep happening to me?! What's wrong with me?!\nCyril: A-are you OK?\nManuela: I was sure I'd be happy this time! Why, oh why, oh why do I always struggle in love?\nCyril: Please, let go of my sleeve.\nManuela: If I let go, you'll just run away! Won't you?\nCyril: Yes.\nManuela: Nobody wants to listen to my romantic tragedy. But I saw you, Cyril, and I thought, \"Cyril will listen because Cyril is good people.\"\nCyril: ...OK, I surrender. What do you want to say?\nManuela: I knew I could trust you, Cyril. You're such a good boy. Such a good young man.\nCyril: How can I help ya? Is it just with listening?\nManuela: Oh, it's a real tragedy. Let me tell you that. Yesterday, I was hitting it off with a man I'd seen a few times at the pub... When I looked in his eyes, I thought he was the one. But then... Well, we were drinking and enjoying ourselves and all of a sudden... Poof! Gone! He just vanished. I feel like I've heard this story before... Can you believe he treated me so cruelly?\nCyril: Yeah, this is all real familiar.\nManuela: My heart is in tatters! I can't believe anyone could throw away a woman like me! Cyril, be honest. What's wrong with me?\nCyril: You drink too much, blame others for your behavior, and you don't understand you gotta love yourself before someone else can love ya back.\nManuela: Maybe he wasn't for me anyway.\nCyril: If you're gonna take off after a few drinks, who needs ya?\nManuela: Right? I think you're too young to understand, but I also think talking to you made me feel better. Yeah! You know what, Cyril? I'm gonna come talk to you more often.\nCyril: ..._Cyril: Manuela? What's she doing down there?\nManuela: Ugh... What'd I do to deserve pain like this?\nCyril: Oh...right. Same thing as always. She seems fine. I oughta just keep walking. See no evil, right?\nManuela: Stay! Right! There!\nCyril: Ah!\nManuela: Cyril! It must be a little dollop of destiny, meeting you here! Listen, you wouldn't leave me when I need a little help, would you?\nCyril: Umm... OK, what do you need?\nManuela: That's my boy, Cyril. You're a saint. I don't want to be trouble, but get me water. And medicine. Now. Please? Phew! I feel a bit better now. Thank you so much, Cyril. My sweet, dear, little Cyril.\nCyril: Professor Manuela, why do you do this to yourself? It makes you feel so bad the next day I don't see the point.\nManuela: Oh, you know... Sometimes I'm upset, and... Well, that's it, really. It's not something a kid like you could understand. Maybe one day. Or not. Who knows. All I know is that my head aches...\nCyril: Professor, isn't this stuff why you keep running men off? And them running is what upsets ya. Then you do this all over again.\nManuela: You can't understand heartbreak until you've felt it for yourself. But when you're older, your heart will break, and I'll make sure to be there...to get you water and all that.\nCyril: Um... That's OK.\nManuela: You're always so nice and sweet, Cyril. I'll pay you back. Promise.\nCyril: Nope! No thanks! No reason to. You don't have to do anything.\nManuela: Oh, don't be shy!\nCyril: I'll be waiting in the wings for that little heart of yours to shatter.\nManuela: Hahaha! Oh, Cyril... What were you saying? I interrupted, I think.\nCyril: I was just saying I need to get going. Lotta work to do. Lots. OK. Bye._null_null_null_null_
11_38_Cyril: Hey, Shamir? How do you think I'm doing with my bow lately? Think I'm getting pretty good? I hit closer to the bull's-eye today, and that felt real good.\nShamir: You were fine.\nCyril: \"Fine\"? That might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me, Shamir.\nShamir: You take too many direct shots though.\nCyril: But it's easier if you shoot straight.\nShamir: Of course it is. But if you can hit your enemy with a straight shot, you're too close. Tell me, Cyril. What's an archer's greatest weakness?\nCyril: Umm... When we get too close to the enemy and we can't shoot the way we're supposed to?\nShamir: Exactly. As an archer, your position is critical. Know exactly how far the enemy is and keep a minimum safe distance. Understood?\nCyril: You mean to stay away from the enemies but not too far away or my arrows can't hit 'em.\nShamir: So you understand why you can't rely on straight shots. You have to use curved shots as well. Never run up to your target. Hit them from a safe range. Shoot 'em from a safe range with curved shots. Archers should always control the battlefield.\nCyril: OK, yeah, I get that. I'm gonna go practice some of those curved shots right now.\nShamir: You're not a bad student. If nothing else, you have the right attitude.\nCyril: You think so?\nShamir: Keep it up.\nCyril: I will._Cyril: Um, Shamir? How do you figure I did today? In the battle, I mean. I tried to not get close to the enemy, and I even used some curved shots just like you taught me, and that was pretty good, huh?\nShamir: You did well. You maintained a safe distance.\nCyril: \"Well\"! That's even better than \"Fine\"!\nShamir: Is that worth celebrating?\nCyril: Ha! You said I was \"fine\" before—now you're saying I did well, and that's a big improvement. Especially since everyone knows you're always so strict.\nShamir: I give praise where it's due. To that point, you've made incredible progress. At first you couldn't even draw a bow.\nCyril: Um, at first you wouldn't even let me hold a bow.\nShamir: Hah! Really?\nCyril: You just gave me a stick with a piece of string tied on it, and you made me practice with that. Honest, I figured you were bullying me.\nShamir: ...\nCyril: I was really, really close to giving up, but then you finally gave me the bow. I mean it. I was mad. I'd done all the stuff you told me to, and I knew the way I was supposed to stand, and I could pull the string just so, but...\nShamir: Maybe I was testing you. Seeing if you'd give up. You're the one who insisted that I teach you archery. I never intended to take you on as my student.\nCyril: I just wanted to do whatever I could for Lady Rhea. More than just cleaning and chopping wood and such. I thought maybe I could help with the fighting, but I didn't know anything about swords, and archery was always something that interested me, so... You really helped me out with my dreams, even though you didn't get anything out of it, and that's really nice of you.\nShamir: I gain nothing personally, but the whole army benefits if you're skilled.\nCyril: And those of us from outside of Fódlan should support one another, right? But it's always been you helping me! I'm gonna keep working real hard with that bow so I can help you back._Shamir: Listen carefully, Cyril. This is important. Are you interested in becoming a better archer?\nCyril: Um, yeah. I always wanna get better.\nShamir: Good. Then you need to find another teacher.\nCyril: What? Why would I need another teacher?\nShamir: Because I said so.\nCyril: Have I done something wrong, Shamir?\nShamir: Not at all.\nCyril: Why do I need a new teacher then?!\nShamir: I simply have nothing left to teach you.\nCyril: Nah, that can't be true.\nShamir: It is. Your fighting style is fundamentally different from mine. I'm a sniper. I find a secluded spot on the battlefield and pick my enemies off one by one. But you, you're a harrier. You weave in and out of the battlefield, assailing the enemy with rapid fire.\nCyril: A sniper...and a harrier?\nShamir: Correct. And your progress has revealed where your strengths lie. I've taught you as much as I can. You'll have to find a teacher who specializes in your tactics if you wish to grow.\nCyril: Hmm... No. You're my teacher. That's how I want things. I don't know about specializations or whatever, but I know I don't want a different teacher.\nShamir: Then you'll never improve.\nCyril: I'm fine with you, and I don't want anyone else! I only want you, forever and ever!\nShamir: ...\nCyril: ...\nShamir: OK, Cyril. Let's forget this conversation ever happened. And...thank you. Now stop standing around. We have work to do.\nCyril: Yeah... OK._null_null_null_
