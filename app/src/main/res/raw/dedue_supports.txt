If you have the time, then please assist me. I am to water the flowers in the greenhouse.\n(Byleth nods)\n\nDedue: Thank you. Only do not water the ones in that corner.\nByleth:\nUnderstood.\nWhat kind of flowers are those?\nDedue: They are from Duscur. They require a dry environment. The roots will rot otherwise.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: They’re beautiful.\nChoice 2: You seem to know a lot about them.\nChoice 3: They sound difficult to care for.\nDedue:\nChoice 1 response: Yes, they are.\nChoice 2 response: I know enough.\nChoice 3 response: That is what makes them worthwhile.\nDedue: …\nByleth: …\nDedue: I owe you a debt of gratitude. In both the extracurricular activities here at the academy, and on the battlefield... Your presence has been instrumental in the defense of His Highness. You have my sincerest thanks.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I did only what anyone would do.\nChoice 2: Think nothing of it.\nDedue:\nChoice 1 response: I see.\nChoice 2 response: To me, it is not nothing.\nDedue: …\nByleth: …\nDedue: Was there something else you wanted?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I’ll go fetch the water.\nChoice 2: No, that’s all.\nDedue: Then please, excuse me.\n(Dedue leaves)\n\nByleth: (He’s difficult to hold a conversation with...)_Dedue: …\nByleth: …\nDedue: Here you are again.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I came to check on the flowers.\nChoice 2: I was just passing though.\nDedue: I see. The flowers you helped to water are now in bloom. Have a look.\nByleth: Aren't they lovely?\nDedue: Indeed. My sister was fond of this one in particular.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Where is your sister now?\nChoice 2: I didn’t know you had a sister.\nDedue:\nChoice 1 response: Dead.\nChoice 2 response: It never came up.\nDedue: Duscur is a dead land. Its flowers were all trampled under the boots of soldiers. But seeing this blossom brings back memories.\nDedue: …\nDedue: I do not know why I am telling you all of this.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'd like to hear more.\nChoice 2: You are unusually talkative today.\nDedue:\nChoice 1 response: There is little to tell.\nChoice 2 response: It surprises me as well.\nDedue: But if you are from Fódlan, you must know what became of the people of Duscur. The people who betrayed their allies from Faerghus. The ones who were punished for regicide. The Duscur are shunned for their crimes, even now. It would be in your interest to not spend any more time around me than necessary.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Dimitri doesn't shun you.\nChoice 2: I don't care what other people think.\nChoice 3: I'll spend my time however I like.\nDedue:\nChoice 1 response: His Highness is an exception.\nChoice 2 and 3 response: You may think little of it now, but your reputation will eventually suffer.\nDedue: But...to be completely candid... It pleases me to be able to speak with you like this. If you truly do not mind, I would be glad to receive more visits from you in the future._Dedue: …\nByleth: …\nDedue: Here for the flowers again?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That’s right.\nChoice 2: Not particularly.\nDedue:\nChoice 1 response: I see.\nChoice 2 response: You might as well have a look, while you are here.\nByleth: …\nDedue: …\nDedue: I have two things to say. First, I thank you for supporting His Highness in my absence. But I must also admonish you for taking your own well-being too lightly. On several occasions, I have seen you protect others by putting yourself in harm’s way. I am grateful for your efforts, but I feel you should place a higher value on your own life. His Highness relies on you... As do I.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You need not worry.\nChoice 2: I understand.\nDedue: Then show that with your actions. We cannot afford to lose an invaluable asset like you. And...\nByleth: And?\nDedue: This greenhouse would be a more lonely place without you in it. It would not be fair to the flowers, to leave me as their only caretaker. Hm. Someday, I hope to show you a whole landscape of these flowers in full bloom.\nByleth: You mean Duscur?\nDedue: Yes. Once this conflict is over, and His Highness ascends the throne, I believe it can be done. You must live at least until then. Understood?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Understood.\nChoice 2: Same to you.\nDedue:\nChoice 2 response: That’s true enough.\nDedue: I had not thought much of my own life, until now. Except that I would gladly cast it aside for His Highness. That is still true, but now I desire to see the end of this war. Until I can show you the fields of Duscur in bloom... I will go on living._null_null_null_

Just like last time...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What are you doing here?\nChoice 2: I thought you were in Fhirdiad.\nDedue: I needed to speak with you.\nByleth: With me?\nDedue: Yes. When I left the capital, I told His Majesty I would be leaving his service.\nByleth: What?!\nDedue: He accepted my decision with a smile. I do not think I have finally accepted it myself yet, to be honest.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I can't believe it.\nChoice 2: Why would you leave him?\nDedue: It was all so that I could give you...this. (presents ring) I have come to ask for your hand in marriage... I adore you. I understand that, as the new archbishop, you cannot take marriage lightly. But even in the face of rejection, I cannot leave these words unspoken. May I have your answer?\nByleth: I accept.\nDedue: You do? You...will marry me?\n(Byleth nods)\n\nDedue: …\nByleth: …\nDedue: I am not good with words. Would you really have me, uninteresting as I am?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I would have you just as you are.\nChoice 2: I appreciate your brevity.\nDedue: I see. Why are you making that face? Is it so odd to see me laugh?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You have a wonderful smile.\nChoice 2: Not at all.\nDedue: I see. Well then... I have one more request. I know it is sudden, but will you prepare to depart on a journey?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: A journey?\nChoice 2: This is so sudden.\nDedue: I told you once before that I would like to show you the fields of Duscur in bloom. I know that you cannot leave the monastery for long due to your position, but...\nByleth: I can't wait to see them.\nDedue: I am excited also. To show you the flowers as they are meant to be seen, in my homeland... And to be by your side in all the days to come. Yes... It is a fine night, indeed.
12_13_Dedue: Your Highness, the hour is late. May I ask where it is you're going?\nDimitri: I'm off to the library for a bit of research before I train. After that, a bath and bed.\nDedue: Very well. I shall accompany you.\nDimitri: Ah, no, there's no need for that. I am a grown man, after all.\nDedue: You sustained an injury during yesterday's training. My presence may be of use to you.\nDimitri: It was a mere bruise that will heal in no time. No need to fret over me, Dedue.\nDedue: Are you dissatisfied with me, Your Highness? Please do not hesitate to correct me.\nDimitri: And there it is again.\nDedue: Yes? What is it?\nDimitri: Well... You often choose to address me as \"Your Highness.\" When we first met, you used to all me by my name.\nDedue: That was because I was unfamiliar with Fódlan speech. Thinking back, such rude manners were inexcusable.\nDimitri: To be honest, I much preferred it. I feel more comfortable being addressed by my name, rather than with the honorifics that go along with being a prince.\nDedue: But...\nDimitri: I did not teach you to read and write so that you'd know how to address me properly. And I brought you to the academy as my friend, not a vassal.\nDedue: But Your Highness, a vassal is precisely what I am.\nDimitri: So much has happened since we met, yet we cannot seem to bridge this gap... So be it. I give you leave to return to your quarters. Take an early night and reflect on what I've said. Please.\nDedue: I couldn't possibly. I said I would accompany you, did I not?\nDimitri: True, but I would much prefer that we take steps to ease this mindset of yours..._Kingdom Soldier: He's always with that man from Duscur. How strange...\nKingdom Soldier: I'll be he used some dirty tricks to gain his favor. That's how those scoundrels from Duscur operate.\nDimitri: What pleasant conversation you seem to be having. May I join? Please, continue.\nKingdom Soldier: Oh! Um! Your Highness... I was just...\nDimitri: I said continue.\nKingdom Soldier: I... I... I'm sorry, Your Highness!\nDimitri: Such foolishness runs rampant. I fear it is the reality of Faerghus for now.\nDedue: It must appear strange to them, to see me always in your company.\nDimitri: Does it bother you, Dedue?\nDedue: Of course not. However...\nDimitri: Let me guess. You take exception to the gossip that you used dirty tricks to obtain your position. Is that it?\nDedue: That does perturb me. But not for my own sake. I am concerned about Your Highness's reputation.\nDimitri: We're not talking about my feelings, but yours. As far as I'm concerned, those fools can talk nonsense until their tongues fall out.\nDedue: I am afraid I cannot agree. But if you were not concerned for your honor in this instance, then why did you intervene?\nDimitri: Because it is my duty to do so. The day my father was killed, I saw the swine who did it. They were not of Duscur. I saw that. Knew it, beyond a doubt. And yet I was unable to prevent the massacre that followed. Nor could I clear away the dishonor of regicide that has unjustly clung to you and your people! I will not rest until I make up for that. I owe you, just as I owe the spirits of those I let die.\nDedue: I do consider Faerghus to be abhorrent. But you are an exception. You offered me your hand, and pulled me out from an abyss of suffering and death.\nDimitri: …\nDedue: You risked your life to save a foreigner you had never met. The moment you extended your hand, I decided that only for your sake would I live the remainder of my life. And I would cast it aside in an instant if my death were to your benefit. For that reason, I cannot consider myself your friend. There are still many in the Kingdom who despise the people of Duscur. It would be selfish of me to stand by your side as an equal.\nDimitri: Dedue...\nDedue: Your Highness?\nDimitri: Do your really believe I care one bit about the chatter of the ignorant?\nDedue: Of course not. Please forgive my impudence.\nDimitri: I understand the intention of your words. Still, they grieve me. If you wish it so, you may continue to think of yourself as my vassal. I clearly cannot stop you. We need not be anything more, or anything less. If that is what you wish, Dedue, so be it.\nDedue: Your Highness..._Dedue: Your Highness, you still have scars on your back. It does you no good to languish in pain. I will procure some medicine.\nDimitri: No, it is fine. They are still deep...these are from nine years ago. They do not hurt any longer. Besides, it would be a shame if the scars I got from protecting you were to fade. I bear these scars proudly. It makes me think that it was worthwhile that someone like me survived.\nDedue: To hear you say such things...\nDimitri: Dedue, you say that I saved you, but do you know that you also saved me that day? If I had been unable to save anyone, I would have been the sole survivor. I would have had no reason to keep living. But I saved someone—saved you. That and that alone has always been my crutch.\nDedue: When I stood before those soldiers and their swords that day, I was prepared to die. But then you suddenly appeared, and you shielded me. I knew then that a savior's hand could reach into even the deepest darkness. I still have not been able to repay that debt.\nDimitri: Have you not heard a word I've said? You have saved me in countless ways. Five years ago, I did nothing but await my execution within my jail cell. Was it not you that saved me?\nDedue: That was nothing more than my duty as your vassal.\nDimitri: Listen, Dedue... Perhaps you consider me to be someone special. But I think the same of you. You are irreplaceable. Cherished. So stop saying that we cannot be friends. Stop saying such awful things.\nDedue: Please...do not look at me that way. You promised me you would build a Kingdom that is proud to boast of Duscur blood. In this Kingdom, where there is no distinction between the people of Duscur and the people of Fódlan... Will I finally, without reservation, be able to call you my friend? Will I...Dimitri?\nDimitri: Dedue... Yes, you will call me your friend, again and again. No matter how many hardships I must endure...\nDedue: I will do all I can to bring about that world as well. To be your friend...is what I have always wanted.\nDimitri: Is that so? I...I am glad to hear it.\nDedue: But until that time, we must allow no harm to befall you. So please call upon me when you walk alone at night. And even when you go out in the day, please tell me where you are going, and whom you are meeting.\nDimitri: In the end, I suppose there is no fixing your overprotectiveness, is there... I suppose I can live with that._null_null_null_
12_16_Felix: Hold a moment, dog.\nDedue: Are you speaking to me?\nFelix: I don't see anyone else here, do you? You're that boar's lapdog.\nDedue: Do not mock His Highness.\nFelix: Ha, spoken like a good pet. Why do you follow him with such devotion? Do you really think a man like that is worth it?\nDedue: Faerghus destroyed my homeland. Burned it all to the ground. Slaughtered my people.\nFelix: The punishment of Duscur.\nDedue: My father, my mother, my siblings—all were killed. We received no aid. No respite. Faerghus murdered our dignity and torched our pride. His Highness is different. He is the only one who sees my people as human. He risked his life to save mine. And it is thanks to him that I no longer wish for death.\nFelix: That's what we call \"blind obedience.\" Tell me. Would you give your life for him?\nDedue: Yes.\nFelix: And what if he commanded you to join him in a senseless massacre?\nDedue: I would do it.\nFelix: Even a massacre of children, or the elderly, or your own comrades?\nDedue: Without hesitation. You have misunderstood me. I am the sword and shield of His Highness. Weapons do not have a will of their own.\nFelix: Blind obedience. You're right. I did misunderstand. I shouldn't have called you a lapdog. You're a rabid cur. You and the boar prince make quite a team—two crazed animals.\nDedue: I warned you not to mock His Highness. I am aware you have a history of friendship with him, but one more word...\nFelix: I've said my piece. Scamper back to your master._Felix: Hey, wait.\nDedue: What is it.\nFelix: You defended me in battle. Why?\nDedue: His Highness does not wish for our military strength to be depleted. The loss of your strength would be significant.\nFelix: You are a colossal idiot. One slip-up and you would have died. You think he would've been happy about that?\nDedue: No, I do not.\nFelix: Then why protect me? I thought you were his mindless weapon, his sword and shield.\nDedue: I heard about your brother. He was at Duscur. He died to protect His Highness.\nFelix: He did, but I don't see that that has to do with anything. Are you repaying some kind of debt? I hope you're not going to praise his death. I heard enough of that from my old man.\nDedue: I will not praise it, then. Instead I will say I would have done the same in his position. Is it really so unnatural to put one's life on the line to protect a brother in arms?\nFelix: To hear a rabid dog call me a \"brother in arms\"...\nDedue: Your insults are merely an attempt to avoid addressing me as what I am. I am a man of Duscur. Yet you were concerned for my life.\nFelix: \"Concerned\" is a strong word. Your death would have been unpleasant. That's all.\nDedue: Coming from you, that is enough.\nFelix: What's that supposed to mean? I just meant—Never mind! OK, go ahead, protect me. But if you act like a fool and get yourself killed, I'll kill you.\nDedue: How can you kill me, if I am already dead?\nFelix: I... You-you know what I meant!_null_null_null_null_
12_39_Sylvain: Dedue, hey. Oh! I'm sorry. I hope I'm not bothering you. Looks like you're pretty deep in thought.\nDedue: Does it?\nSylvain: I just wanted to stop by and ask... It was your turn to cook last night, yeah?\nDedue: Uh, yes.\nSylvain: Well, it was great. I was wondering if you could give me some tips. You know, teach me how to cook. I hear a girl loves a man who can cook.\nDedue: Sylvain.\nSylvain: Yeah?\nDedue: You are from Faerghus. You must understand how it appears for you to spend time with one from Duscur. To be near me invites tedious misunderstanding.\nSylvain: Oh, please. I don't care who misunderstands what about me. I talk to who I want. Besides, I believe the Duscur people are innocent.\nDedue: You do?\nSylvain: Faerghus and Duscur have been friendly since, heck, forever. So why would our old friends from Duscur just up and assassinate our king? It doesn't make sense. Sure, there are probably folks from Duscur who don't like Faerghus. But do I think there's enough of 'em to mount an attack and slaughter the king and his whole company of elite guards?\nDedue: It is difficult to believe, considering the discrepancy in skill and number.\nSylvain: Right? At most, I can see a misguided group of people from Duscur conspiring with someone else who had plans to dethrone the kind. Maybe they were even lured into participating and used as scapegoats. Regardless, it doesn't concern you or the rest of your people. A person can't be judged by the worst of their kind... Or else where would any of us be? Besides, people like to talk about me anyway. So let them talk.\nDedue: …\nSylvain: OK... You're making a weird face. What did I say?\nDedue: I have misjudged you. I was under the impression you only cared about women.\nSylvain: Heh heh... Well, I'm glad I've cleared up that misunderstanding. But really, there's no way I'm the only person who figured all that out. There must be people who think like me in Fhirdiad, including his Highness.\nDedue: Agreed. But whatever the truth, we are still perceived as traitorous assassins.\nSylvain: Once a misunderstanding takes hold, it isn't easy to clear the air, not without solid evidence of the truth. But even if we found evidence that your people are innocent, those negative sentiments wouldn't disappear overnight. The only thing that can change that is time and effort. Depressing isn't it?\nDedue: Time and effort. Yes, I believe you're right.\nSylvain: Man, that got serious. Shouldn't we lighten things up with a nice cooking lesson?\nDedue: Very well._Sylvain: Ah, this is delicious. I can't believe I made it!\nDedue: Yes, you do have some talent.\nDedue: …\nSylvain: What's the matter? Have I got something on my face?\nDedue: No, Sylvain. Recently I've heard rumors about you.\nSylvain: Oh yeah? Which ones? Is it that I'm terrible to girls? Or the rumor where I bring some terrible misfortune to the girls I date? I don't, by the way. In case you're about to ask. Oh! I also heard about how I'm total trash and everyone should avoid me. That might be my favorite.\nDedue: Well, you don't lack for self-awareness.\nSylvain: The way I figure it, if I can't be respected, I can at least be well-informed.\nDedue: You are being described as indefensibly worthless.\nSylvain: Indefensibly? Heh, that's a bit harsh.\nDedue: I already knew your reputation concerning women. But these new rumors deprive you of all redemption. I did try to correct them. But I doubt I was believed.\nSylvain: Well, thank you all the same. Listen. You don't need to worry what people think about me. As you well know, it's not easy to correct misunderstandings or change people's minds. And if I'm going to behave so badly, it seems misunderstandings are inevitable.\nDedue: I could not be silent. You saw me as a person, rather than merely as someone from Duscur. I want you to be seen as a person too.\nSylvain: I appreciate that, Dedue. You think the world will ever see us that way?\nDedue: Maybe.\nSylvain: I can't tell if you're joking or not. But I like it.\nDedue: Then we will get along._null_null_null_null_
12_33_Mercedes: Dear Goddess. Please protect us...\nDedue: Mercedes.\nMercedes: Oh, Dedue. Was there something you needed?\nDedue: His Highness sent me to collect you.\nMercedes: I see. I’ll be with you in just a moment. I’m almost finished here.\nDedue: You were praying.\nMercedes: I was. Praying for everyone’s safety. And praying for good desserts tonight, and that the greenhouse flowers will bloom.\nDedue: The Fódlan goddess will accept prayers of any sort.\nMercedes: It’s true. I’ve thought the same thing myself. That reminds me, Dedue. Weren’t you born in Duscur?\nDedue: Yes.\nMercedes: Do the people of Duscur pray to the goddess too?\nDedue: Duscur had a very different view of religion.\nMercedes: Oh?\nDedue: In Duscur, there were many gods. The sky had a god. The earth had a god. We made offerings to the war god for victory in battle. Held feasts for the sea god to calm the waves.\nMercedes: So your people prayed to different gods depending on what they needed?\nDedue: Correct.\nMercedes: Your beliefs sound so different from ours! Tell me more.\nDedue: Why? Duscur is a ruin.\nMercedes: Duscur may be gone, but you’re still here. Would you tell me more about it the next time we meet?\nDedue: If you insist.\nMercedes: Really? That would be great! I’m looking forward to hearing more soon.\n(Mercedes leaves)\n\nDedue: Duscur is gone, but I’m still here..._Mercedes: Ah, I think I get it. So, the sky god got into an argument with the earth god, then Duscur was created?\nDedue: To oversimplify it somewhat, yes.\nMercedes: There’s something so mysterious about it. There are only mountains separating us from Duscur, but it’s like a completely different world. This has been so interesting. I’ve never learned so much about it before!\nDedue: There are not many left to pass on the legends of Duscur.\nMercedes: Really? That’s a shame. It’s almost like when someone dies, or a family line ends. I think a place is only truly destroyed when there’s no one left to remember it. You should tell more people about Duscur to keep it alive.\nDedue: That is a strange thing to say.\nMercedes: Oh? Why do you think that?\nDedue: Duscur is forever the enemy of Faerghus. No one cares about our culture or history.\nMercedes: I’m different though. I don’t know anyone who was killed by the people of Duscur. I don’t hold a grudge against you and I never have.\nDedue: …\nMercedes: Um, Dedue? Is this recipe from Duscur?\nDedue: You don’t care for it?\nMercedes: No, no! I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Would you teach me how to make it soon?\nDedue: But it seems I am ever the teacher with you, and seldom the student.\nMercedes: You’re right. I'm so sorry. Ah! I have an idea! My mother taught me to bake the perfect sweets to go with tea. Would you like to learn how to bake them? It’s a secret Martritz family recipe that’s been passed down for generations!\nDedue: House Martritz of the Empire? I thought they were no more.\nMercedes: It’s true. My father’s family was wiped out in the Empire. I’m the last living descendant.\nDedue: Are you certain you wish to impart such precious memories to me?\nMercedes: Of course! Now that my family’s gone, I’m the only one who knows the secret! The sweets would vanish from Fódlan if something happened to me.\nDedue: I see your point. Yes, I would like to learn._Mercedes: Oh, Dedue! Are you praying to the goddess of Fódlan? That seems odd. Won’t the Duscur gods be upset if they hear you praying to another land’s deity?\nDedue: The Fódlan goddess was recognized in Duscur too. The deities of foreigners are seen as the protectors of their respective lands. It has been said that we would offer our prayers to her in times of war.\nMercedes: Huh. So, the goddess is part of a pantheon... I guess that’s one way to interpret it. Anyway, what are you praying for?\nDedue: For peace to come even one day sooner.\nMercedes: That’s a lovely prayer. I was just thinking about praying for that myself.\nDedue: I see.\nMercedes: Hey, Dedue? What are your plans for yourself once this war is finally over?\nDedue: To serve His Highness for the rest of my days.\nMercedes: I thought you might say that.\nDedue: And you?\nMercedes: That’s a good question. I was thinking about traveling to Duscur.\nDedue: To Duscur? There is nothing of interest left there.\nMercedes: Isn’t it where you were born? And isn’t it where your wonderful food and stories come from? I think those are reasons enough to visit at least once!\nDedue: Mercedes... If you will allow it, I would like to accompany you. His Highness would surely grant me leave to go.\nMercedes: You really think so? Then I hope the war ends as soon as possible!\nDedue: As do I.\nMercedes: We’re going to have to shower the goddess with prayers. We’ll pray that she watches over and protects us while we work to end this war. Then, when it’s finally finished, we can travel!\nDedue: That promises to be interesting. We should pray to the Duscur gods as well.\nMercedes: Yes! That’s a brilliant idea! Which of the Duscur gods should we pray to?\nDedue: For victory, we pray to the god of war. Or...\nMercedes: Or?\nDedue: Just the god of war.\nMercedes: Come on! What were you going to say?\nDedue: Ugh...\nMercedes: Oh! I know! It’s the god of travel, right?\nDedue: Let us leave it at that.\nMercedes: I knew I was right! You taught me so much about your gods! So let’s pray. For the end of the war and for our safe travels to Duscur._null_null_null_
12_25_Dedue: Are you injured?\nIngrid: No.\nDedue: Good.\nIngrid: …\nIngrid: I’d have cut my way through. Alone. Without your assistance.\nDedue: My apologies.\nIngrid: Your apologies are empty.\nDedue: …\nIngrid: I... I spoke out of turn. I’m sorry, Dedue. His Highness has put his faith in you. You’re a valuable comrade, no matter my feelings. I... The people of Duscur...\nDedue: Save your breath. There were countless people like you in the capital. People who spat, threw things— insults and stones alike— whenever they pleased. Their anger was natural. I do not begrudge them.\nIngrid: I... I see.\nDedue: You owe me no apology. And I will keep my distance on all other occasions. But on the field of battle, allow me to aid you. If you were to fall, His Highness would grieve.\nIngrid: I see. Then I will accept your help. On the battlefield.\nDedue: Understood._Dedue: Are you injured?\nIngrid: Dedue. Saving the day again?\nDedue: Apologies.\nIngrid: I’m the one who owes you an apology. You’ve saved my life how many times now? If I keep being so callous, I’ll seem ungrateful.\nDedue: No matter.\nIngrid: But...\nDedue: I’m accustomed to it.\nIngrid: I’m sorry, Dedue.\nDedue: Why?\nIngrid: Because the way I speak to you is unnecessarily harsh. The truth of it is, I lost someone very dear to me in Duscur. The punishment came swift to your people, and when I heard of the slaughters... Well... I thought it was a punishment well earned. I thought the people cruel and heartless, deserving of the tragedy that befell them.\nDedue: …\nIngrid: But you? You’re different. You seem nothing like the people of whom I speak. So why not speak back against how I and so many others feel? Why not question this unfair prejudice, and tell me I haven’t the right to hold a grudge against you? If you’d just speak to me— if you’d tell me the truth about all of this...\nDedue: I do not the truth of it, myself. His Highness says the tragedy was not the fault of my people. But just like anywhere, there were many different people in Duscur. Some very good, and others very bad. It is not unimaginable that some may have conspired to take part in that wickedness. Perhaps we are merely victims. Or perhaps we are regicidal monsters.\nIngrid: Whatever the truth of it is, you are not to blame. The people I hate are the ones who are responsible for that whole mess. You... you just got caught up in all of it.\nDedue: Ingrid.\nIngrid: You’ve rushed to my side— you’ve saved me countless times. I am sorry for how I’ve treated you. Truly.\nDedue: If you think of my as your ally, that will suffice. For me, that is enough._Dedue: …\nIngrid: Uh, Dedue? Are you OK? You look unwell.\nDedue: Ingrid. Is my face frightening?\nIngrid: Uhh... What? I mean... um, sort of— er, not exactly... I wouldn’t use the word frightening. Aggressive, maybe? But it’s really nothing to worry about. Why— did someone say something cruel?\nDedue: I made a village child cry.\nIngrid: Oh. I see... Let me guess. You feel like you look frightening, so you walked around with a smile glued to your face...\nDedue: How did you know?\nIngrid: I’m starting to understand how you think. The thing is, forced smiles never work well. They usually just end up making a person look creepy and insincere.\nDedue: I see. Duly noted.\nIngrid: To be honest, when we first met, I was pretty intimidated by you. Not because of a smile, but a lack of emotion whatsoever. And you so rarely spoke. I had no idea what to make of you.\nDedue: …\nIngrid: But that’s only because I wasn’t making an effort to get to know you. Because you were from Duscur. As I started to get to know you— to understand your personality— I realized what a fool I’d been.\nDedue: Personality?\nIngrid: You may come off as intimidating, but underneath that cold exterior is a kind, loyal, and noble person— a really wonderful person. In a certain regard, you are one of the knightliest people I know.\nDedue: …\nIngrid: What is it?\nDedue: Wonderful person. This is the first time anyone has ever said a thing like that to me. It is rather... awkward.\nIngrid: It’s only awkward if you make it awkward. Which... it kind of is... now.\nDedue: Ugh...\nIngrid: Ugh...\nDedue: Well... let me know if you need anything.\nIngrid: Yes, of course. Same to you, Dedue._null_null_null_
12_18_Flayn: Ahhh, tonight's meal looks exquisite! Time for me to make the most of this opportunity. MmmMmMmm!\nDedue: Are you all right? Slow down. Your dinner is not going anywhere.\nFlayn: I am not sure it is your business to tell me how to consume my meal. You must admit this food is absolutely delectable! I have not eaten something this tasty in ages!\nDedue: Well, good.\nFlayn: I suppose my enthusiasm is a tad overwhelming. Do you happen to know who cooked this meal?\nDedue: I did.\nFlayn: You are the chef?!\nDedue: Today, yes.\nFlayn: I...I do not think I have ever been brought to tears by a meal... Dedue, you are a chef without peer! Why, that was truly more delicious than anything I have eaten in all my years!\nDedue: I highly doubt that.\nFlayn: No need for modesty. I could certainly never make anything even remotely so delicious. Hmm, that gives me an idea. Will you please teach me how to cook such delicacies as the one I ate just now?\nDedue: You want me to teach you to cook?\nFlayn: Indeed! I have never been so emotional over cuisine — you must teach me your ways!\nDedue: Very well. But only if you are serious and do not quit halfway through.\nFlayn: I would not dream of it! Thank you, Chef Dedue!_Dedue: Chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces. After that, skim the top layer off the pan. Be mindful of the heat.\nFlayn: Certainly, Chef Dedue.\nDedue: There’s no need to call me that. Are you displeased?\nFlayn: No, not in the slightest! I just got momentarily sleepy. It happens to me from time to time... Let me see... First, chop the vegetables. Coming right up, Che— Er, Dedue!\nDedue: Good.\n(screen briefly fades to black)\n\nFlayn: I am so bored... Day in and day out, it is nothing but dicing vegetables and waiting for water to boil. I want to feel like I am actually cooking. It is not as though I do not know the basics... He could at least let me hold the spatula sometime...\nDedue: Next, we peel the vegetables.\nFlayn: Chef Dedue, I was hoping to speak with you regarding something that has been on my mind.\nDedue: Speak?\nFlayn: Surely you have noticed my skill while wielding pans and knives. Therefore, I think it is time you taught me how to cook— beyond all this water boiling and vegetable chopping business.\nDedue: Impossible.\nFlayn: But why?!\nDedue: All must be done in the proper sequence. And the first step here, whether you like it or not, is to learn how to use the tools perfectly.\n(Dedue walks away)\n\nFlayn: Come now! You have seen how I use a ladle! You know I’m good for it. Hmph. He has left me no option but to take matters into my own hands. Stubborn you may be, Chef Dedue, but I will show you the true meaning of delicious!_Flayn: Er... Hello there, Dedue... I just want to say that I am really, terribly sorry.\nDedue: For what?\nFlayn: I, um... I tried to cook. On my own. It was an absolute disaster. Adding that seasoning... Adding all that seasoning. Ugh, what a mistake.\nDedue: Mistakes happen.\nFlayn: But Chef— that is, Dedue! I defied your instructions! Quite blatantly, I might add. I tried to cook before I had gained mastery over the tools. I have been a terrible student... Are you going to stop teaching me now?\nDedue: Is that what you want?\nFlayn: Not in the slightest. I desperately want to learn from you.\nDedue: As you were, then.\nFlayn: You... I... Truly?!\nDedue: You have not disappointed me. The food itself tasted awful, of course. But there was more to it than that. I could feel the thought you put into it. The wish to please others. To be faithful to what you’ve learned.\nFlayn: You... you actually ate the food I made?\nDedue: I did. The ingredients were chopped to perfection. You also seem to have learned how to handle fish without my instruction.\nFlayn: I learned by watching you.\nDedue: You have talent. One day you will surpass me.\nFlayn: I was certain you would be angry with me. It is decided, then. Someday, you will exclaim that something I have made is delicious. I do not quite know how many years it will take, but I am willing to rise to the challenge. Please, help me get there!\nDedue: I will. However long it takes, I look forward to it. Now, your next lesson will consist of the selection and seasoning of ingredients.\nFlayn: Of course, Chef— er, Dedue, rather.\nDedue: Call me whatever you want.\nFlayn: Oh! This is exciting! Let me see... Chef Dedue! Master Chef Doodah? Ooh, Supreme Chef Deddie-pie!\nDedue: I suppose I’ve already committed.\nFlayn: Oh, I know! Chef Deddles!_null_null_null_
12_19_Gilbert: Ah, hello. Dedue, yes?\nDedue: Finished praying?\nGilbert: I am, yes. You have grown much since I saw you last. You are a man now.\nDedue: You barely know me.\nGilbert: True. I suppose we did only meet a handful of times.\nDedue: As haggard as you look now, you were even worse when I last saw you in the capital.\nGilbert: Haggard, eh? True enough.\nDedue: Still weighed down by the same regret, I see.\nGilbert: I was unable to protect the king. That is the ultimate failure. One I must atone for.\nDedue: If you have the spare time to beg forgiveness, then pick up a lance and train.\nGilbert: That would do nothing to atone for the dead.\nDedue: Your prayers are mere self-indulgence.\nGilbert: You do not understand.\nDedue: No, I do not. Faerghus needed you. His Highness needed you.\nGilbert: There was no other choice but for me to leave. What would you have done if you were in my place? If His Highness had died due to your failures?\nDedue: If he commanded me to live, then I would live. Otherwise, I would die with him. I have nothing left to lose other than His Highness. Home, family— All but that man, I have already lost.\nGilbert: …\nDedue: You were a knight in service to the king for decades. Not only did you excel in bravery, wisdom, and tactics, but in matters of character you were an ideal knight. Utterly above reproach. That is what His Highness has always said. I have only come this far by modeling my conduct after his stories of you. But now...\nGilbert: Forget those words spoken by His Highness. I am no different a man than I was before... Beaten down by sin. Alone and weak. I am lost and irredeemable._Gilbert: Impressive that you made it back, Dedue. It was you who saved His Highness from prison... We— all of us— thought you were dead.\nDedue: My wounds were severe, but I managed. So long as I draw breath, I fight for His Highness.\nGilbert: Is that so...\nDedue: But in my absence, you have protected him. Thank you, Gilbert, for returning to us.\nGilbert: Stop. I left once... I have wondered if I will be forced to leave once more, after this battle is done.\nDedue: Would you accept that? I imagine not.\nGilbert: Of course not.\nDedue: You are still Gustave at heart, even now. I am not fit to replace you. Not yet. I still have a great deal more to learn. For now, all I can do is continue to be a shield for His Highness.\nGilbert: It is unlike you to be so talkative.\nDedue: I could not be silent.\nGilbert: So long as you understand... I will leave the Kingdom some day. It may not be until the day I die, but the time will come... This war... I'm a much older man than I was when it began.\nDedue: …\nGilbert: Sooner or later, someone must take my place. Do not try to carry the weight alone, Dedue. There are many talented and well-trained officers. Work together with them to assure our king’s future. Do that, and when the time comes, I will rest well.\nDedue: Thank you for the advice. However...\nGilbert: Yes?\nDedue: It is too soon to treat you like an old man. You still have at least ten years of service in you. Faerghus— no, His Highness— needs you. As do I. Save the old man talk for when you are truly senile.\nGilbert: A fair point. There’s no reason to let old age make one timid.\nDedue: Even as I work to surpass you, I still rely on you.\nGilbert: Is that so? Well then, we have more fighting ahead of us, Dedue. We should get to it... For the future of Faerghus._null_null_null_null_
12_38_Dedue: Shamir.\nShamir: Ah. It’s... you. What is it?\nDedue: I have a message from His Highness. He will meet you in front of the library tomorrow evening.\nShamir: Evening. Library. Front. Got it. Oh, one more thing...\n(Shamir swipes at Dedue)\n\nDedue: …\nShamir: A bug landed on your shoulder. Sorry if I startled you.\nDedue: Hm.\nShamir: Anything else?\nDedue: No.\nShamir: Good.\nDedue: You get to the point. It makes you easy to deal with.\nShamir: Likewise. No need to say what isn’t worth saying, right?\nDedue: Precisely. Few others seem to think so.\nShamir: Agreed.\nDedue: …\nShamir: …\nDedue: That is all. Farewell.\nShamir: Farewell._Shamir: Dutiful as ever, Dedue.\nDedue: What are you suggesting?\nShamir: You’re always busy delivering messages.\nDedue: You mean His Highness’s orders.\nShamir: Does he need you to run such trivial errands?\nDedue: He should not trouble himself over them. I am honored to attend His Highness, and to represent him in all matters. Ever since he saved my life, serving him has given me reason to live.\nShamir: Reason to live? Huh.\nDedue: Your relationship to the archbishop seems similar.\nShamir: Not quite. I joined the knights to repay a debt I owed Rhea. The debt’s been repaid, so she’s nothing more than a former employer.\nDedue: Then you are not motivated by loyalty.\nShamir: Not especially. I wouldn’t call Rhea my “reason to live.”\nDedue: And if a higher-paying employer comes along?\nShamir: I’d consider it. That’s what mercenaries do.\nDedue: Then yes. We are completely different.\nShamir: Everyone’s different. I’m not trying to criticize your loyalty. I’ve seen a lot of people like you all over the world. They don’t tend to last very long though. Try not to end up like them.\nDedue: Thank you for the warning._Dedue: Is this your dagger, Shamir?\nShamir: I thought I lost it in battle. Thank you. I wonder if this dagger will ever fulfill its purpose...\nDedue: Unexpectedly sentimental. I did not think you would be the type to let personal feelings affect you in battle.\nShamir: I try to think of it as just work, but I’m still human. Was there anything else?\nDedue: I was hoping we could chat.\nShamir: That’s not like you. Our only common ground is brevity. Now you want to chat? What’s gotten into you?\nDedue: Despite our superficial similarities, we are actually completely different. So I am interested in learning more about you.\nShamir: The feeling is mutual. Being born in Duscur, you’re an outsider here in Fódlan. I’ve devoted myself to Fódlan, but really I’m an outsider too. So there are some things that connect us.\nDedue: You are diligent. As am I.\nShamir: Even so, I am not like you and never could be.\nDedue: I could never be like you, either.\nShamir: That’s just how people are. Even people with deep romantic or familial connections will never be identical.\nDedue: That is why we should try to understand each other.\nShamir: Hmph. At least you’re easy to talk to. You could make a good partner for a mercenary like me.\nDedue: And you could make a good partner for one as devoted to the Kingdom as I.\nShamir: That depends on how much your master would pay.\nDedue: I would expect no less.\nShamir: Enough chatting. We should prepare for battle.\nDedue: Yes. We should talk again, when we have time.\nShamir: I’m always around._null_null_null_
