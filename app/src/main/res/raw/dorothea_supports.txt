14_41_Dorothea: Well, I had fun today. Of course, you'll want to see me again, yes?\nKnight: O-of course! I'd love to, Dorothea!\nDorothea: Well, until we meet again!\nDorothea: Oh! Hello, Professor. Were you...watching that?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's a different guy than I saw you with yesterday.\nChoice 2: ...\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: Yes... Is there a problem with that?\nChoice 2 response: You look like you have something to say, Professor.\nDorothea: Look, I know what I'm doing. My acclaim as a diva won't last forever, after all. I must look to the future. As a man, you may not feel so rushed about these things, but I know my beauty will eventually fade.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: We all feel anxiety about aging.\nChoice 2: Getting older doesn't bother me at all.\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: You? Really? I never would have guessed.\nChoice 2 response: I wish I could be that easy going.\nDorothea: Anyway, I'm not just playing games with these boys. This is for my future. You have no right to object. I very much want to find a good partner here at the academy. Someone who will take care of me for the rest of my life.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Do what you will.\nChoice 2: Is that really what you want?\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: I'm glad you understand.Not everyone appreciates the necessity of taking the initiative while you're still in your prime. Or are you just saying that?\nChoice 2 response: Finding someone to take care of me? Of course it is! Who could ask for anything more?\nDorothea: Anyway, I value your opinion, Professor, but I won't have you interfering with my life plans. Unless you'd like to take care of me into my old age? That'd be something, eh? How about it, Professor?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: OK.\nChoice 2: I don't think so.\nDorothea: I wasn't – You aren't being serious, are you? I was just teasing. Or did you really just consider spending your whole life with me? If you did that...that actually makes me... It makes me happy. I had no idea you might look at me that way. You've gotten awfully quiet... You might even be blushing a bit. Have I embarrassed you? If so, I'm very, very sorry. I should be going anyway. I'll see you later... Professor._Dorothea: ...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What's wrong?\nChoice 2: Troubles with love?\nDorothea: Professor?? I – Oh...don't worry. It's nothing. ... Actually, could we talk for a bit? Somewhere a little more...private?\n(Dorothea leaves. Byleth follows.)\n\nDorothea: ... I'm just gonna come right out and say it. I find you a little difficult to be around. I know, I know. I'm your student and you're just trying to watch out for me. But the way you look at me sometimes...it's like you're seeing right through me.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm sorry.\nChoice 2: Seeing through you?\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: No, don't apologize. I know you don't mean anything bad by it. I'm just self-conscious, I guess.\nChoice 2 response: Don't worry. I know you don't mean anything bad by it. I'm just self-conscious, I guess.\nDorothea: The thing is, I don't have anything to call my own. No land, no birthright, no fortune. Little knowledge or battle skill. I think that's why I always clung to my popularity as a diva. Even after leaving the stage behind, I sort of kept up the act. When I look at you, it's like your eyes are accusing me... Telling me that you see right through it. That's what I mean when I say it's difficult to be around you. Hey, uh, this might be nuts, but maybe you could show me some kind of weakness of yours?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Excuse me?\nChoice 2: I have no weaknesses.\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: You know my biggest fear. If I know one of yours, maybe I'll feel less, I don't know...vulnerable.\nChoice 2 response: Oh, come on, Professor. Everyone has some kind of weakness. You know mine. If I know one of yours, maybe I'll feel less, I don't know...vulnerable.\nByleth: Well, if it would really help...\nDorothea: Excellent. Well then, don't mind me.\n(Brief blackout.)\n\nDorothea: You know, Professor, I never hear any gossip about you. Of a romantic nature, I mean. Would I be right in assuming you're not very... experienced with romance? Maybe we should find out somehow... (Pause.) Um... Professor? What's with you? Why aren't you reacting to anything I'm doing? Come on! Is your heart even beating? You're making me lose my confidence...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sorry.\nChoice 2: Actually, my heart isn't beating.\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: That's all right. I didn't really think a little tease like that would be enough to get to you, anyway. Though it does still make me lose just a little confidence in my own charms...\nChoice 2 response: Ha, don't be so silly... Huh? It really isn't beating?! Is what I'd say if I was more gullible. You're just fooling around, Professor. I'm not sure how you did it, but that was a good one._(Location: Greenhouse)\n\nDorothea: This may seem a bit sudden, but...I want to thank you, Professor. That is, for letting me live my life the way I want. I've noticed you've been giving me fewer of those soul-revealing gazes lately. I appreciate you making an effort to not trouble yourself over who I spend my time with.\nByleth: So, you found me out...\nDorothea: Well, of course. Did you think I wouldn't notice? It's kind of sweet, in its own way.\nByleth: I don't know what you mean.\nDorothea: If you say so...But I notice you doing it all the same. It's kind of sweet, in its own way.\nDorothea: Professor, may I tell you a story about when I was younger? I was an orphan, living in the back alleys of Enbarr, until one day I was overheard singing... That was when my new life began. I was suddenly a songstress in the Mittlefrank Opera Company. Performers, nobility...I met so may people. But none of them ever really knew me. I was just some young pretty girl who could sing, a spectacle to be admired. Even though everyone praised my looks and my voice, and they showered me with gifts... I knew, one day, I'd be old. My looks would fade, my voice would change, I wouldn't sound the same. And I started to wonder, when I did get old, what would I have left? I'd be old, alone...and back on the streets of the capital, right where I'd started.\nByleth: I don't believe that's true.\nDorothea: You can never be certain about what the future will bring.\nByleth: I won't let you be alone.\nDorothea: That's sweet of you, even if you are just flirting.\nDorothea: I never had much to begin with in life, and I worry that one day, I'll be that way again... That's why I keep searching for someone who will love me. Someone unaware of the songstress, who can love a girl that used to be scared and alone on the streets of the capital... I wonder if such a strange person can even exist._null_null_Dorothea: Oh, is this where you've been? Everyone's looking for you. With the war over, I'd like to think they's at least give you a few days' rest. Don't worry, I won't tell them you're here. It's a rare occasion for me to have you all to myself.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Not looking for a guy to share the victory with?\nChoice 2: Did you ever find your \"strange person\"?\nDorothea:\nChoice 1 response: No. I've given up on that. I realized there was no point. Besides, maybe the person I've been looking for is closer than I realized.\nChoice 2 response: See...there is one person I must confess I'm just a little bit interested in.\nByleth: In that case...\n(Byleth presents Jeralt's ring to Dorothea.)\n\nDorothea: What? Is that— That's a ring. It would be embarrassing If I had the wrong idea, so i have to ask... Are you proposing? Here? Now? T-to me?\n(Byleth nods.)\n\nDorothea: I don't know what to say. Are you sure? You want to spend your life with...me?\n(Byleth nods.)\n\nDorothea:Even though I'm not a songtress anymore? And I don't come from a noble family or have any wealth or land to my name?\n(Byleth nods.)\n\nDorothea: You won the war. You could pick anyone in the world. Why would you...\n(Byleth shakes his head.)\n\nDorothea: OK. I mean, yes. Yes! I love you madly and I'd be happy to marry you! But if we're going to be married, I had better think up a cute nickname for you. Don't you think? Oh, I wonder what I should call you now... Darling? My beloved? So many options! I starred in so many operas where I captured the heart of my beloved... But I never dreamed that it would feel this wonderful when it actually happened\n(S Support Artwork)\nDorothea:A life singing for you in a peaceful world...I imagine that life will be more wonderful than i ever could have hoped. I love you. I could never sing anything as pure as those three little words.

14_15_Dorothea: Hey, Edie! Uh-oh, you're scowling again. You're going to get wrinkles all over that cute face of yours if you don't smile more.\nEdelgard: Hello, Dorothea. I was just lost in thought. There are so many things to be done-to think of them makes my head ache sometimes. So many nobles of the Empire are utterly useless. When I am emperor, I intend to appoint only those who can actually be useful. It doesn't matter if they're of noble or common birth.\nDorothea: Noble or common, eh? Can you really do that?\n(Alternative, post time skip) I intend to appoint only those who can actually be useful. It doesn't matter if they're of noble or common birth.\n\nDorothea: Noble or common? And you assume that'll be OK?\nDorothea: I mean, not that I don't agree. I'd make all those nobles vanish if I could...\nEdelgard: Don't worry. I will make that a reality. It's not a question of can or cannot. All that matters is doing it and doing it right. The nobility system has only been around for twelve-hundred years. The concept didn't exist before that.\nDorothea: \"Only\" 1,200 years, huh? You always say such preposterous and extraordinary things, Edie. Yet somehow, you actually make it work for you. It's like you're a character from an opera.\nEdelgard: A character from an opera... Hm. If an opera is made about my life someday, I wonder how I'll be portrayed. The revolutionary who guided the Empire to a new dawn...or the foolish ruler who took her revolution too far...\n(Alternative, post time skip) The emperor who brought everlasting peace to Fódlan...or the tyrant who shed the blood of her people...\n\nDorothea: Well, that all sounds pretty violent. But either way, it would make an incredible opera. Do you figure it'd be a grand action piece full of combat and strife? Or would you prefer a somber political drama? ♪ Hail the mighty Edelgard, though red blood stains her story... ♪ ♪ Heavy as her crown may be, she will lead us all to glory... To a brighter dawn, we shall carry on... Hail Edelgard! ♪\nEdelgard: That's quite enough, Dorothea. I'm starting to feel more than a little embarrassed. Lovely as your voice is, let's just hope that any operatic productions about me are still a ways off._Dorothea: ♪ Humm, hu-humm, hu-humm... ♪\nEdelgard: You're in high spirits today, Dorothea.\nDorothea: Yes... I have met someone quite charming recently.\n(Alternative, post time skip) I am. There is someone whose company I have come to enjoy.\n\nDorothea: I'm hoping we can spend more time together soon.\nEdelgard: Well, I wish you the best of luck. I wish I had some advice to offer. Alas... I do not.\nDorothea: Eh, don't worry too much about it, Edie. I'd guess romance isn't really something you're interested in anyway.\nEdelgard: I'm not completely disinterested.\nDorothea: Oh, yeah? Is there someone you have your eye on?\nEdelgard: Hmm... To be honest, there's nothing resembling romance in my life at present. It's not that I'm disinterested. I'm simply too busy with other endeavors. I have no time to spare for such things.\n(Alternative, post time skip) A certain face comes to mind at the thought...though I'm not sure you could call what we have a romance just yet.\n\nDorothea: That's not surprising. You're not just any old noble, after all. Anyone who has feelings for you... Well, they're in for a pretty complicated life.\nEdelgard: True. And I can't ignore the possibility that I may have to marry for political purposes. I doubt I'll ever have the opportunity for a passionate romance as long as I live...\nDorothea: That's no way to talk. You meet the right person and boom! You'll have passion to spare. Could be someone you've just met, or someone you've known your whole life... There's no telling how life will go. Something could even spark between the two of us!\nEdelgard: You and I? Now that is an entertaining thought. If such an exciting future is in store, I look forward to it!\nDorothea: Oh yeah? That's awfully sweet of you, Edie._Dorothea: Hey, Edie, take a look at this! I received it as a gift... It was sent from... Hmm. I don't remember. Anyway, the point is...\nEdelgard: Dorothea... When you receive a gift, don't you think you should try to remember who it's from?\nDorothea: You're right. That's a little thoughtless of me.\nEdelgard: What's gotten into you lately? You seem mostly uninterested in the various suitors throwing themselves at you. Is something on your mind?\nDorothea: Oh, don't worry about me. Everything's fine. I'm just not that interested in...certain men. I'm just finding it difficult to care about chasing after love as much as I used to.\nEdelgard: Do you have any idea why?\nDorothea: Well, I do have an inkling...\nEdelgard: You seem reluctant to tell me... Is it somehow my fault?\nDorothea: No, no, nothing like that. OK, I suppose you're not completely wrong, but...\nEdelgard: How do you mean? Please, just say what's on your mind.\nDorothea: When the two of us are together, talking like this... Somehow I don't feel like I care about my troubles with love anymore. So, it's fine.\nEdelgard: Hmm... There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it seems we should get to the bottom of such a drastic change. Maybe we can figure it out if we just-\nDorothea: Edie. I'm telling you I'm fine. If you push me any further, I'll write an opera about you. I'll do it right here and now. And then I'll sing it in your face!\nEdelgard: Settle down, Dorothea, I can take a hint! If you insist, I'll drop the subject. Whatever you do, don't write more opera lines about me. My cheeks are probably still red from your last performance.\nDorothea: Well, I can't promise anything. But if I try real hard, by the time the war is over I might just have an opera written, starring you! No need to worry though, Edie. I'll be fabulous as you. A performance they'll rave about for years.\nEdelgard: Ugh, the frightening part is that I don't know whether you're joking or not. But I do regret to inform you that you won't be playing the role of Edelgard.\nDorothea: Why's that?\nEdelgard: Don't you see? No story about me would be complete without the character of Dorothea. It would be ridiculous for you to play me instead of yourself.\nDorothea: Edie... You really are something special, aren't you?_null_null_null_
14_23_Hubert: Completely unreasonable. How will I see to this...\nDorothea: Hubie? What are you doing here?\nHubert: A routine matter. No cause for concern.\nDorothea: Ah, so it's something to do with Edie, then.\nHubert: And?\nDorothea: She really is all you ever think about, isn't she? Look, I know you're doing all this so she'll like you, but if you go to far, she'll end up pushing you away. Maybe even hate you.\nHubert: This has nothing to do with swaying Lady Edelgard's sentiments. I am simply her humble servant. I do what is in her best interest. Whether she cares for me or not is irrelevant.\nDorothea: It really doesn't look that way to me. I bet you'd follow any order Edie gave, if you thought it would make her like you. Am I right?\nHubert: Any order? What a thing to suggest. But the answer is no. I will decline any directive that I deem would not be beneficial to her.\nDorothea: Is that right? So, just for example... if Edie commanded you to find yourself a suitable wife, would you do it?\nHubert: If it would benefit her in some way for me to marry, then yes, I would marry.\nDorothea: It's easy to say that now, with no bridal party in sight. But if it was the day of the wedding? Nah, I don't believe that.\nHubert: I don't care what you believe. My only wish is to see Lady Edelgard fulfill her ambitions. All other matters pale in comparison.\nDorothea: Hubie. \"Pale in comparison\"? You've seen too many operas. I don't think you understand how the world works. At all.\nHubert: And I don't care what you think, either. I would make any sacrifice to support Lady Edelgard. It's a shame you've never experienced such devotion.\nDorothea: You're right. I don't have anyone like that right now. But... maybe someday I will?\nHubert: Then maybe someday you'll understand. Until then, we will never see eye to eye. Now, if you will excuse me, I have much to do.\n(Hubert leaves)\n\nDorothea: Hubie, I don't get you. Although I do find your point of view just fascinating..._Dorothea: Hey there, Hubie. I've been thinking about our conversation the other day... And I've just got to know... do you really love Edie?\nHubert: If it's one or the other, I suppose it would be closer to love than to hate. Why?\nDorothea: Ahh, I knew it! That's why you work so hard for Edie! Oh, Hubie, I finally get you. You're just another servant suffering from unrequited love for their mistress.\nHubert: You completely misunderstand. Unrequited love? Do I really look like the kind of drooling simpleton to have that kind of motivation?\nDorothea: I'd like to say yes, but I know you'd just argue. Fine, Hubie. Tell me your situation.\nHubert: My situation is simple. I am walking a path.\nDorothea: Oh, do go on.\nHubert: Everyone has a path in life. Lady Edelgard has shown me mine. It is just beside her own. So we walk together, side by side. We stride ever forward, yielding to nothing and to no one.\nDorothea: So... you're sharing the same dream?\nHubert: Bluntly, yes. But it's more than just a shared dream. I have many feelings toward Lady Edelgard. Gratitude. Respect. Awe. Empathy. Trust. Hope.\nDorothea: OK... I was teasing you, but I gotta say I'm just a little bit jealous of you and Edie. That you're able to embrace these feelings and stride forward along the same path... You're lucky, Hubie. I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to experience anything so utterly... operatic.\nHubert: Why not?\nDorothea: Because I figure that the best quality in a partner would be that they make me happy. And loving another is really about wanting to be loved. I'm pretty sure that's different from how things are with you and Edie._Dorothea: Hubie, I've been thinking...\nHubert: What's all this about now?\nDorothea: It's about what you said before... about your path.\nHubert: You mean the path that Lady Edelgard and I walk?\nDorothea: I guess I don't really understand that kind of thing, since I've always been focused on my own goals... But you, Edie, Professor... All of you are fighting for an ideal. That's big. It touches everyone. Then there's me, with my hands full thinking of just myself.\nHubert: One person seems enough to me.\nDorothea: Hmm... Maybe you're right.\nHubert: Do you have something more to say, Dorothea? It is unlike you to seem so uncertain.\nDorothea: I guess so. I'm sorry, Hubie. It's just... I've been thinking a lot lately... About whether Edie might command you to marry me.\nHubert: What?\nDorothea: Perhaps Edie might command you --\nHubert: No need to repeat it. I heard you quite clearly.\nDorothea: Like I said, my hands are full thinking of just one person. But if you and I were devoted to one another... maybe we could strive for the future you believe in. Maybe I'd finally understand your path and be able to think about more than just myself.\nHubert: Seems it's my turn to not understand. Did you just propose marriage as a way to get to know me? How exactly would such an arrangement benefit me?\nDorothea: Oh, it'll benefit you.\nHubert: Go on.\nDorothea: Well, this \"path\" you're walking with Edie will have one more loyal follower. Isn't that enough?\nHubert: I suppose it may well be. Your contribution to our cause has been noteworthy. I've no complaints about your battle prowess either. And if you were able to walk the path as I do... that would be something very special.\nDorothea: So, will you consider it? This is all because of you, you know. You made me wonder what it's like to be wholly devoted to another person...\nHubert: Heh. All right. I'll consider it._null_null_null_
14_17_Ferdinand: Ah, Dorothea! The dining hall seems so much brighter with you here.\nDorothea: Ferdie! I must say you are quite adept with flattery. Please, give me some more.\nFerdinand: Flattery? No, I was not... There you go with that attitude again. Why do you reserve such cold treatment for me, and me alone? Do you hate me, Dorothea? Or have you some other reason to avoid my company?\nDorothea: I underestimated you. I assumed your noble upbringing had dulled your perception. But you got it right on your first try. I hate you.\nFerdinand: Huh, I was right. Might I ask why you find me so despicable? I can scarcely guess.\nDorothea: Don't waste another minute thinking about it.\nFerdinand: That will not do. I do not think you would hate a person for no reason.\nDorothea: Hm, perhaps. How's this? If you can guess why, I'll let you know if you're right.The brains of us commonfolk are so simple, it should be pretty easy for a big-shot noble to sort out.\nFerdinand: Very well. I cannot walk away from a challenge. I have no choice but to chance a guess. You are always making fun, calling me a \"big shot\" and so forth. Perhaps you think all nobles are... No, it could not be that simple.\nDorothea: Oh? What can't be that simple?\nFerdinand: Please. Will you not give me a clue?\nDorothea: Well, let me see. A good clue... I know! It's because you're like a bee. That oughta be enough of a clue. So long, Ferdie.\nFerdinand: A bee? I haven't the slightest... Perhaps because I am such a diligent worker?_Ferdinand: Ah, you have arrived at just the right time. Care for one of these handmade treats?\nDorothea: My goodness, Ferdie. When did you become such a talented confectioner?\nFerdinand: Oh, Dorothea! I am hardly an expert.\nDorothea: Nevertheless, you have managed to make some tasty-looking treats.\nFerdinand: Well, it is the first time I have tried my hand at it. Honestly, there were several unsuccessful attempts preceding this batch. I made these pastries to solve that riddle you gave me. The reason you despise me.\nDorothea: Oh?\nFerdinand: You said I was like a bee. The bee is a dutiful worker, just as I am. But the bee inherits a capacious home, with a wealth of honey. Similarly, I inherited my fortune. I did not receive it as a reward for my labor. I surmised that perhaps you'd feel differently about me if I earned something all on my own. That was my plan. To emulate your transformation from desperate pauper to successful songstress.\nDorothea: All on your own? Did you renounce your nobility? Give away your riches?\nFerdinand: No, I made these! I obtained all the ingredients on my own, without anyone's help.\nDorothea: You mean... you got the sugar and the flour.\nFerdinand: Yes. To earn the flour, I worked in the fields. To earn the sugar, I carried a merchant's wares.\nDorothea: Who did the cooking? You?\nFerdinand: Naturally! I took on some extra chores in exchange for use of the kitchen at night.\nDorothea: I have to admit, that's impressive. Hey... It looks like you had a bit of an accident. Is your hand OK?\nFerdinand: I burned myself a little while I was baking. Nothing to worry about.\nDorothea: Nonsense. That burn will scar, you know. Come on, let's get you to the infirmary.\nFerdinand: Wait! Dorothea! You have yet to try my treats...\nDorothea: You should be fine now, Ferdie. Big-shot nobles have to treat their bodies with care just like the rest of us.\nFerdinand: There you go again. Noble this, noble that. Though you did say it with less disdain than usual.\nDorothea: Nothing gets past you. As it were, I may have reconsidered you a little.\nFerdinand: You have reconsidered me? Finally! Just as I had hoped, we are becoming friends. Now then, I propose that we ---\nDorothea: I only said I reconsidered a little. And you still haven't figured out why I said you're like a bee. Which is funny, because you look like a bee right now. Bye!\nFerdinand: So, I am still a bee. A completely mystified bee..._Ferdinand: Ah, Dorothea. I am surprised to find you here. I did not think you were all that religious.\nDorothea: There's a lot you don't know, Ferdie. But you're right. I'd hardly call myself devout. After all, it was thanks to the goddess and her noble regime that I suffered so much as a child.\nFerdinand: You must be quite brave to speak so coarsely in this hallowed place. But what do you mean... about suffering as a child?\nDorothea: Ugh... Do I really have to tell you? Oh, forget it. I'm sure you already know that I'm an orphan. I grew up in the alleys of Enbarr, begging for coins, eating scraps, drinking from drains.\nFerdinand: I see. I remember seeing street children around the city...\nDorothea: I could've died. Then the right person overheard me singing... And suddenly I was in the opera. I was a songstress. And my goodness...did the nobles like me. The people who used to spit on me and call me an urchin? They praised my voice and my beauty. A nobleman who had once kicked me, gave me the most gorgeous shoes. I almost asked if it was a joke.\nFerdinand: So that is why you despise nobility. But why do you think I am the same as them? Do you really believe that is the kind of man I am? You think I would ever treat people differently based on appearances? There is nothing noble about that!\nDorothea: Oh, really? You're something different? That's not how I remember things... It was the very day that I was discovered... I was in high spirits. Nothing was wrong in the world. I secretly bathed in one of the town's fountains, hoping to wash off some of the dirt from the streets. I sang the same song the opera composer overheard earlier that day. And that's when you appeared.\nFerdinand: Me?! No... It could not have been...\nDorothea: Don't play dumb. You glared at me, the same look I'd gotten from every other noble. Then you ran off. When we met at the academy, you were a different person. All smiles and friendly words. You were like a bee, Ferdinand. A bee attracted to a flower in full bloom.\nFerdinand: So, it was you then, singing that song... Dorothea please listen. This is a misunderstanding. When I saw you... I could not take my eyes off you. I was hypnotized. Your beautiful voice, your elegant face...droplets of water on your skin that glittered in the sun. I thought you were a water nymph.\nDorothea: Stop it. Don't lie to me.\nFerdinand: No, it is true. I was only a child. The vision overwhelmed me. That is why I ran. I plucked up the courage to return, but no one was there. I thought perhaps it was a dream...\nDorothea: ... Maybe I can believe you. I've wanted to ever since the day you made me those treats... I thought then that maybe you weren't like the others, but... There's a lot I have to let go of, Ferdie.\nFerdinand: Of course. I am glad we had this conversation. You know, I do not mind you thinking of me as a bee. Life as a simple drone, circling a queen... It actually sounds quite wonderful.\nDorothea: Don't drones keep the queen safe from other bugs? I like the sound of that._null_null_null_
14_28_Linhardt: I do believe a nap is in order...\nDorothea: Oh, this is lovely... Just feel that breeze.\nLinhardt: Dorothea? Whatever are you doing here?\nDorothea: I was thinking of relaxing here, but it looks as if someone else is lounging in my spot already. taking a nap in public like this? Really, Lin. The nobles look down on such behavior.\nLinhardt: You do know I am of noble birth.\nDorothea: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just teasing. You never do act very noble though. Why is that?\nLinhardt: Each person must follow their own way. This is how I prefer to live. Even if some of the more pretentious nobles like to poke fun at my ways.\nDorothea: Doesn't that bother you? I mean, really? It doesn't hurt your pride or anything?\nLinhardt: What use is pride? It doesn't feed nor clothe you. It offers no warmth on a cold night.\nDorothea: First time I've heard a noble say something like that.\nLinhardt: Well, most nobles are... Oh, what is the polite way to say it? Fools. yes. They are fools. As for myself... My father is the Minister of Domestic Affairs, and he has pride enough for the both of us. For example, did you know he and the Minster of Military Affairs cannot get along, although they value each other greatly? His pride gets in the way, so he can't make amends. That is why there was discord between civil ministers and military officers in the Empire. And so pride serves no good purpose in politics either. So tell me, what use is it?\nDorothea: I wonder if bad blood between civil and military leaders is somewhat unavoidable. The Minister of Domestic Affairs is in charge of all civil officials, so if they just give in easily, their subordinates would lose respect, right? I get the feeling that if your pride isn't equal to the responsibility you bear, then you aren't fit to lead. Also, I happen to think pride can be quite charming.\nLinhardt: And how interesting is charm? It just gets in the way of living your life.\nDorothea: If you lack charm, nobody will give you a second glance.\nLinhardt: Right, which means more time for napping.\nDorothea: Lin... You can't really believe what you're saying, can you?_Soldier: How did you know Dorothea was an orphan?\nSoldier: I hear she buttered up some noble and he enrolled her in the academy..\nSoldier: She's higher ranking than us lot. How disappointing.\nDorothea: ...\nLinhardt: I suggest ignoring them.\nDorothea: Ah! Lin, don't scare me like that!\nLinhardt: You seem less scared than surprised, but that's quibbling, I suppose. As for those two gossips? Unimportant. I suggest forgetting all about them and their petty words. Join me for a meal. I've been the target of a lot of gossip, and eating generally makes me feel better.\nDorothea: Don't pretend we're the same. If I could brush it off so easily, I would.\nLinhardt: It doesn't seem particularly difficult. Where's the problem? Is this about your pride?\nDorothea: No. Not even a little bit.\nLinhardt: What then?\nDorothea: Lin. please just...go away. I want to be alone right now.\nLinhardt: That's fine. But your life is your own business. It's not something that can be affected by the petty words of a stranger. Ah, sorry. I kept talking, didn't I? I'll stop now.\nDorothea: Please do._Linhardt: Ah... Here you are.\nDorothea: What's up, Lin? Come to invite me to dinner?\nLinhardt: Well, that too, but first there is something I wish to say. I believe I previously implied that it's OK to live out your days by running away from what troubles you. And I think that I was unkind to you.\nDorothea: What are you talking about?\nLinhardt: To be honest, while I try to be easygoing, I currently feel a bit uneasy about something. One of the effects of running away constantly is that eventually one runs out of places to, well, run. Because I avoid memories I find unpleasant, the number of things I avoid is forever increasing. I've never learned to deal with the pain of my past, so I can never increase my tolerance toward new pains.\nDorothea: And?\nLinhardt: That's all. But there are some nights where it really worries me.\nDorothea: That's what you wanted to say? It'd be the same if you weren't avoiding things. You'd just be up at night wondering what was coming next.Thank you, Lin. I appreciate you showing me a glimpse of your real self for the first time.\nLinhardt: For the first time? Each time I speak I show my real self.\nDorothea: So, what about that conversation we had?\nLinhardt: Which conversation?\nDorothea: When you said I was a great woman. Was that true?\nLinhardt: Of course. You have too low an opinion of yourself.\nDorothea: I thought you were just trying to make me feel better. I didn't really think you looked at me that way, Lin.\nLinhardt: Why? Is it so strange? You seemed rather happy about it at the time.\nDorothea: Haha, it's not weird... OK, it's kind of weird. Haha... You're weird, Lin. You know, I'm hungry all of the sudden. Maybe I laughed too much.\nLinhardt: Good. I was going to invite you to dinner.\nDorothea: You were?\nLinhardt: When I walked in, you asked if I'd come to invite you to dinner. I said yes. But I can't be bothered walking to town. Shall we visit the dining hall?\nDorothea: What? Oh, fine. Show me this easygoing way of yours._Linhardt: Hmm... Where has it gone?\nDorothea: Lin, you got a moment?\nLinhardt: Oh, Dorothea. Are you done being alone?\nDorothea: Please don't say it like that... I let the gossipers get to me...and I snapped at you. Can you forgive me?\nLinhardt: You have my forgiveness, although I remember no wrong doing on your part.\nDorothea: Oh, well... Thank you, I guess.\nLinhardt: So do you feel better?\nDorothea: About the gossip? Not even a little bit. I... I need someone to talk to, and I figure it should be you.\nLinhardt: Oh? OK. What is it?\nDorothea: About the things that those soldiers were saying... The truth is, I agree with them. Selfish as I am, I curried favor with a noble so I could enroll here. An orphan like me, here. Crazy, right?\n(Academy phase) Everyone else here is noble or rich or both. I don't deserve any of this. Honestly, I don't deserve to be here at all.\n(War phase) And now, to be leading troops as one of the professor's generals... I'm way out of my league.\nDorothea: I'm doing the best I can, of course, but sometimes I wonder if it's enough...\nLinhardt: Dorothea, if I may offer a bit of advice. you have no reason to fave anything you do not wish to. If the past distresses you, then just let it go. It's as simple as that.\nDorothea: But it's my past. You can't escape your past...\nLinhardt: You've probably overcome a lot of tough times, haven't you? I think that's incredible, really, but why not just let go of the suffering and run away from the memories that cause you pain? I suspect you'll find it a better way of living. I know I do.\nDorothea: That's not living, Lin. It's running away. if I leave my hardships behind, then all of that means nothing.\nLinhardt: Good point. Well said. Yet I propose ignoring your past changes nothing of who you are today. I see before me a great woman who should not be bothered by idle gossip. Even if you dropped everything and took a nap for thousand years, you would still be you.\nDorothea: What an example... I don't quite get it, but I am a bit envious of you. Still, I can't live the way you do.\nLinhardt: At least try it. Go take a nap where a noble will see you. Give them something to talk about.\nDorothea: Heh. Maybe I will._B+_null_
14_34_Dorothea: Petra, how are you doing? Getting used to life here?\nPetra: I am settled. Everyone shows great kindness.\nDorothea: I’m glad to hear it. I was so surprised when you first arrived. A princess, all the way from Brigid!\nPetra: You have my gratitude, but please do not call me princess. You are making my cheeks blush!\nDorothea: There’s nothing to blush about. You’re every little girl’s dream of what a princess should be. Anyhow, I suppose it’s been a long time since you’ve been back to Brigid, hasn’t it? I hope you aren’t homesick. Maybe we can cook one of your favorite dishes from back home?\nPetra: I do wish for that, but there is no possibility. The ingredients are not found here.\nDorothea: I suppose you’re right. That’s probably why they don't cook the food of Brigid in the dining hall. I’m sorry. I just got to thinking about how hard it must be to live somewhere so far away from home and... No. It can’t be impossible. I’ll fix you a real meal of Brigid. I’ll just find a recipe and similar ingredients!\nPetra: Wait, Dorothea. It is the thinking that counts. But your cooking is... what is the word... horrendous. That is what everyone is saying, anyway.\nDorothea: Horrendous? Nobody’s cooking can be that bad!\nPetra: The thinking is enough for me. You have my biggest gratitude.\nDorothea: Fine. I’ll do something instead of cooking for you. I just want to be sure that you feel at home here. How about a massage? That may help you loosen up.\nPetra: I have no problems. My body is already able to relax.\nDorothea: Oh? Then perhaps I could sing you lullabies to help you sleep!\nPetra: I am not having sleeping trouble.\nDorothea: Just know that you never have to worry about putting me out. I like helping my friends. Well then, I must be going, but remember my offer.\nDorothea leaves\n\nPetra: Dorothea, is filling my heart full..._Petra: Dorothea, I want to be asking you a question.\nDorothea: Please do.\nPetra: Why have you come to Garreg Mach? Is your goal different from the rest?\nDorothea: Yes, I suppose. Everyone here's an heir or an heiress. But not me. I'm just a commoner. When I enrolled in the Officers Academy I was different than everyone else. I wanted to secure my future and...my big idea was to marry money. Ever since, I've been dating different terribly well-to-do men, searching for a good one... So far there's been no reason for a second date.\nPetra: Marrying money? That is not sounding like a good idea. Money would be a bad husband.\nDorothea: Pretty much.\nPetra: But you treat me well. I have so much gratitude.Why do you show me such friendliness when I am not money?\nDorothea: Oh, no, Petra. This isn't like that. I like spending time with friends. It's wonderful being friends with you, and I hope we can stay close for a long time to come.\nPetra: Yes, I have that hope too. But I have also been thinking of who is good for me.\nDorothea: Oh, I see.\nPetra: And still I am thinking we should be friends.\nDorothea: Oh, I know why. Because we're both trouble for Imperial nobility.\nPetra: Yes, we both have troubles.\nDorothea: Feels nice, doesn't it? Knowing that, together, we can irritate that many people? Since we've already got a lot in common, let's get to know each other better, shall we?_Dorothea: Oh, Petra, are you researching something?\nPetra: Yes, I am investigating useful fighting techniques.\nDorothea: You're always trying to become a better fighter. Personally, I am sick of all the battles.\nPetra: You are... feeling sick about battle? Ah! I understand. Yes, I am also wishing for this war to finish quickly.\nDorothea: Sooner the better. Ugh. I don't even remember the last time I washed my hair.\nPetra: Yes, it is hard to be braiding your hair when it is damaged from lack of care.\nDorothea: Speaking of... You know, I don't think I've seen many braids like yours, Petra. I assume it's a hairstyle from Brigid? May I take a closer look?\nPetra: You may. This style of braiding has been passing... has been passed down through my family.\n[Scene Transition]\nDorothea: How very elaborate! That must take a long time to do.\nPetra: Your words are delighting me. Braiding it does take up a great amount of time every day.\nDorothea: Every day? No, I suppose you couldn't sleep with your hair like that, could you? When there's time, do you think you could teach me? It would be fun to match you every now and then! And once I learn how, I can help you with your hair. What do you think?\nPetra: I am really liking that idea. It would give me great happiness to have our hair match.\nDorothea: Haha, I'd like it too!\nPetra: Dorothea... Before, I had confussion. I thought you were being overly familiar. But then I gained understanding. Now I am knowing that is how you show your kindness, and I have much gratitude for that. It is impossible to be imagining life without you. You are... precious to me.\nDorothea: Petra... What a lovely thing to say. I might just cry...\nPetra: If you will be crying, you can have my... Ah! My shoulder. For your crying.\nDorothea: Oh, I was just playing around. But... if I ever need a good cry, I do hope you'll lend me your shoulder.\nPetra: My shoulder will always be available to you.\nDorothea: Oh yeah? So, I don't even need to make a reservation or anything?\nPetra: A reservation? For... my shoulder?\nDorothea: Oh, I just meant... You know what? It doesn'tmatter. What matters is that I enjoy spending time with you. It makes me stop worrying about marriage and status.\nPetra: If that is the truth, then will you be coming to Brigid with me?\nDorothea: Huh?\nPetra: When this war is finished, I am wishing for you to be seeing my homeland.\nDorothea: You... you are? Oh my. I'd love to, Petra. As soon as the fighting is done, I'd like nothing more than to see Brigid with you._null_null_null_
14_16_Dorothea: Felix, my goodness, I swear you're always training. Such a hard worker. So strong.\nFelix: Hunh! Hah! Hyah!\nDorothea: Hello? Felix?\nFelix: What?\nDorothea: You can hear me. That's good. I was worried maybe your ears didn't work.\nFelix: What do you want?\nDorothea: Oh nothing...Nothing in particular, I mean. But now that I'm here, and now that you've asked... When you've finished up, do you think you'd like to join me in the dining hall for something sweet?\nFelix: I'll pass. I don't like sweets. Also, you're a nuisance. Stay away from me.\nDorothea:\n(Part I): That's not a very nice way to talk to a classmate. Anyway, you sound like you're shooing away a stray cat.\n(Part II): Felix, that's rude. I thought we were on the same side in this war? Anyway, you sound like you're shooing away a stray cat.\nFelix: Shhh. Shut up.\nDorothea: I am not a stray cat, Felix, and I am not leaving until you take a moment to chat with me.\nFelix: You are a pest. Fine-- do what you will.\nDorothea: Oh, you better believe I am going to keep doing exactly what I will.\nFelix: Hah! Hyuh! Hunh!\nDorothea: Hmm...Maybe instead of a sweet treat, we can get something spicy? Would you like that? I've heard the dining hall is serving a dish with some western spices in it. Mmm... Does that sound good, Felix? Would you like something spicy instead of sweet?\nFelix: You're distracting me. When I am hungry, I will eat. Alone. Stop squawking at me.\nDorothea: Well, since you asked so nicely, I'll leave you in peace. Good-bye, Felix!\nFelix: Finally._Felix: You're following me. Stop.\nDorothea: I'm leaving you alone, just as you asked. I may be walking the same way as you, but--\nFelix: What do you want?\nDorothea: You've made it abundantly clear I'm not to want anything from you, including politeness.\nFelix: I heard a rumor that you're planning to settle down with a noble.\n(Azure Moon route) You're trying to get close to me, aren't you? You want to marry into House Fraldarius.\n(Other routes) I abandoned my family, so you'll have to look elsewhere. Not much to gain from marrying me.\nDorothea: Nice try, Felix, but it's not like any old noble will do. I just find you interesting is all. Is that so odd?\nFelix: Interesting? I'm not interesting. What do you mean?\nDorothea: I've never met a noble so...unsociable. Yes, that's the word. Unsociable. Other nobles are quick to be friends, even if it's just because they might gain something from it.\nFelix: The Empire's nobility, maybe. The Kingdom's nobility is a whole different animal.\nDorothea: If they are, so what? You should care how others think of you.\nFelix: Why? I don't answer to them. All that matters is improving my skill. I'll prove my worth on the battlefield. Those people care so much about appearances they can't even see each other. It makes me sick.\nDorothea: Oh, I agree. What's important isn't how someone looks, it's their true nature. I don't pretend to know your true nature. I don't even have a very good understanding of my own. But I suppose you see mine just fine, don't you? Just a silly girl with no thoughts in her head except for marrying a noble, yes? Good-bye, Felix.\nFelix: Hm._Felix: You. Get over here.\nDorothea: “Get over here”? Ha! How about I tell you to get out of here?\nFelix: You’re always following me around. At least make yourself useful. Let’s spar.\nDorothea: What? Are you serious?\nFelix: I don’t joke. Draw your weapon, unless you intend to fight without one.\nDorothea: If you want to train, then do it on your own.\nFelix: If you don’t attack first, I will.\nDorothea: OK. If you want me to knock some sense into you, who am I to say no?\nFelix: For someone whose only aspiration is marriage, you’re pretty strong.\nDorothea: Is this your attempt at flattery? Aw, it is, isn’t it. When I was in the opera, I always trained for self-defense. Couldn’t really get by without it. Nowadays, if you can’t use a sword, then you’re just in the way.\nFelix: Perhaps I had you all wrong. I thought you were just a frivolous girl who cared only for men of status. On the contrary, you seem well aware of the realities of the world. I respect that.\nDorothea: Yeah, yeah. All right. Ahh, I’m beat. I’m going to go sit down and relax with a cup of tea. You’ll join me, naturally.\nFelix: I will?\nDorothea: We just trained together. Are you really going to turn me down?\nFelix: Just this once.\nDorothea: Good, let’s go for tea. While we’re at it, shall you treat me to a meal?\nFelix: Don’t get carried away.\nDorothea: Aw, you’re no fun…_Dorothea: So, Felix, is the tea to your liking?\nFelix: It is.\nDorothea: It’s nice to relax like this every now and then, isn’t it?\nFelix: It is.\nDorothea: You said some of your equipment is damaged, didn’t you?\nFelix: It…it is.\nDorothea: …\nFelix: …\nDorothea: Are you not in the mood to talk? We could discuss your family or what’s happening in high society? Flavors of tea? Your favorite jokes?\nFelix: None of those. I already told you I don’t joke.\nDorothea: Of course, only cynicism. Oh, I know! We’re holding a small opera in the cathedral soon. I’ll be singing too. If you’re interested in… But of course you aren’t.\nFelix: You can sing?\nDorothea: I’m sorry. What did you just say? Can I sing? I was only a diva of the Mittelfrank Opera Company, that’s all.\nFelix: Oh, right. I forgot.\nDorothea: You forgot. Am I that uninteresting to you? What must you think of me?\nFelix: You’re insincere and loud, is what I think. But you do make a good sparring partner. And a good tea companion.\nDorothea: Oh?\nFelix: Anyway. When’s the concert?\nDorothea: It’s an opera. And you don’t have to come.\nFelix: You just invited me. You can’t tell me not to come. That’s for me to decide.\nDorothea: Then you must be there! I’ll sing my heart out, just for you.\nFelix: I haven’t said I’ll go.\nDorothea: Are you going to come or not? If you keep teasing me, I might just pretend to cry.\nFelix: Fine. I’ll go.\nDorothea: Fantastic! I look forward to it._A+_null_
14_39_Dorothea: Ah, Sylvain. It's unusual to find you doing something other than hitting on women.\nSylvain: Ah, Dorothea! I've been preparing to do just that, as it were. My intention is to flirt with the monastery's most beautiful flower...Dorothea herself!\nDorothea: Oh dear, and I've ruined all your hard work. You might as well save the effort. I'm not taking the bait.\nSylvain: Heh heh... Oh, Dorothea, your wit is as sharp as your beauty. Don't you want just a little flirting? Just a sample? I'm not like all the others, you know.\nDorothea: I don't doubt it. By \"not like all these others,\" do you mean how serious you are about being disingenuous when you flirt?\nSylvain: And that is supposed to mean...what exactly?\nDorothea: Your social standing isn't bad, and you're not bad to look at or particularly dumb. You could easily be engaged by now. But you just flit from one woman to the next without settling on anyone. I bet you enjoy going out with them, but you hate women themselves. Don't you think?\nSylvain: Me? Hate women? Haha! That couldn't be further from the truth! I'm always serious when it comes to matters of the heart. When I flirt, I stake my life on it.\nDorothea: Uh-huh. I'll believe it when I see it. Staking your life on a person is the sort of thing you should only do when you're in love.\nSylvain: That's what I've been saying! I love you enough to stake my life on it. And I'm seriously in love with each and every girl I flirt with.\nDorothea: I see. Regardless, I'm not staking my life on you. So you'd better go and fall in love with someone else. Good-bye, Sylvain.\n(Dorothea leaves.)\n\nSylvain: She's stone cold... I love it._Sylvain: Ah, Dorothea. What are you doing here?\nDorothea: I was actually waiting to see you.\nSylvain: Were you doing to invite me out to dinner? I accept.\nDorothea: Yes, I was. I don't think it would be so bad to share a meal with you from time to time.\nSylvain: How about tonight? I'm busy tomorrow...\nDorothea: That's fine by me. What are you busy with, I wonder? Girls? And more girls?\nSylvain: Heh heh, isn't it an unwritten rule not to ask about such things? But what a curious turn of events. Have you perhaps got an ulterior motive?\nDorothea: No ulterior moves. If you're worried, we can just pretend this conversation never happened.\n(Dorothea turns to leave.)\n\nSylvain: No, wait! That's not what I meant. I just don't understand why you want my company now...when you've always been so cold to me. Have you perhaps...fallen in love with me?\nDorothea: Ugh, my stomach just got queasy. You know what? Maybe I'll just eat on my own after all.\nSylvain: Fine, fine. I get it. You want someone to chase your loneliness away.\nDorothea: Something like that, yes. If you don't want to, I'll ask someone else.\nSylvain: Don't dream of it. It would be my pleasure, milady. And to be clear...the reason you chose to spend time with me is my family, yes? Or is it my Crest? Both? I'm just curious about such things. Say I was a commoner. Would you still have invited me to dinner?\nDorothea: Is this really necessary for a simple dinner invitation? Actually, I have a question of my own. Say I was a hoarse-voiced old hag... Would you still be flirting with me? Would you still want to hold my hand and whisper sweet nothings?\nSylvain: That's a difficult question. I have nothing agianst mature women, but...\nDorothea: Even if you were an old man, I still would have invited you out. If you were a former noble exiled from his family, or an orphan from the streets, my heart cares not!\n(Dorothea laughs.)\n\nDorothea: Just kidding. I just wanted to try saying it. Of course it's better that you have money.\nSylvain: Heh, you little... Eh, that's probably true. So, Dorothea, about that dinner?\nDorothea: It would be an honor to have you join me tonight. And let's not talk about things like this over dinner, OK?\n(Dorothea leaves.)\n\nSylvain: Even if I was an old man or an orphan, huh?_Sylvain: Ah, why have I been so unlucky with women lately?\nDorothea: Oh, Sylvain, what's that face for? Have you been dumped again?\nSylvain: Heh, isn't there an unwritten rule you shouldn't ask someone that?\nDorothea: I'm sorry, I thought you didn't mind being dumped. Huh. So your love life can get you down sometimes after all. Who knew?\nSylvain: I'm sad every time I break up with someone! It's just, I usually try to be the one doing the breaking up. I've never had a hard time with girls...ever. Not until recently. But now when I think about it, I wonder what any of them even liked about me. It's not as if any of them knew much about me. I don't get it.\nDorothea: Isn't that what a relationship is for? Learning about someone else? You can't know it all right at the start.\nSylvain: I asked you before, if you would have invited me out if I was a peasant.\nDorothea: You did ask me that, yes.\nSylvain: That was wrong of me to say. I've just... It's not an excuse, but I'm always so suspicious. I'm a nobleman with a Crest. The marriage proposals don't stop coming. Everyone wants me. Except they don't actually want me at all. They want my bloodline. Within my family and without, it's always the same story. Sometimes I think that if I didn't have a Crest, no one would look at me twice.\nDorothea: I see. And... you're probably not wrong. Honestly, I've had those same sort of thoughts myself.\nSylvain: Oh? What sort of thoughts might those be?\nDorothea: I sang, people cheered and applauded, and when I walked off stage, I'd find the same thing every night. A mountain of presents and marriage proposals. But none of those people knew me. All they knew was the singer they saw on stage. All they wanted was my looks and my voice. None of them even tried to get to know the real me.\nSylvain: Heh, I'm pretty sure I've heard this somewhere.\nDorothea: We may come from different places, but we're much the same, wouldn't you say?\nSylvain: Yeah, I suppose we are. Look, Dorothea. I've realized something. Even if you were an old grandma, I'd still flirt with you...and I'd absolutely win you over. Though, I'd much rather be win you over now...and be with you until you become an old grandma.\nDorothea: That might be the most legitimately romantic thing you've ever said, Sylvain. And I can't say I disagree... I'd rather you win me over now too, so that I can stay by your side until you're an old grandpa.\nSylvain: Well, before any of that, will you go to dinner with me?\nDorothea: I'd be happy to._null_null_null_
14_25_Dorothea: Ingrid? Do you have a moment? We're going to perform an opera in the cathedral.\nIngrid: Uh...we are?\nDorothea: Yes! It's a small one, but I need some volunteers.\nLet me tell you, Alois is very excited. He's already doing a ton of work for the show. (If Alois is alive)\nIngrid: I see... What's it about?\nDorothea: Classic opera fare. A tragic love story. A princess who falls in love with a handsome commoner. But our princess, she carries the fate of her country on her shoulders... And no matter how in love she is, she can't just marry whoever she wants... Or can she?\nIngrid: That's quite a story—sounds tragic and beautiful. Who will be playing the princess?\nDorothea: Me. I was a singer in an opera company, though I hope I'm not being too presumptuous casting myself. Even if you're not interested in being part of the production, you will come to see it, won't you? I'm asking everyone to dress up properly. I want it to be a stylish and elegant night.\nIngrid: That does sound quite lovely... And I do want to go, but I...um...\nDorothea: Please don't worry if you can't make it. I understand we're doing this on such short notice.\nIngrid: No, no! It's not that. I just...uh... I struggle with the elegant part of things. I don't really do myself up in elegant clothing and makeup and such.\nDorothea: If fashion's your concern, lady, you're in luck.\nIngrid: I am?\nDorothea: If you don't dress for the occasion, no one will take you seriously. But don't worry about a thing. I'll happily work my magic on you. When it's time, I'll meet you in your room. We'll make you the most beautiful woman in the theater.\nIngrid: Oh, goodness. OK..._Dorothea: ...\nIngrid: Why are you sighing at me like that? Is my face really so hopeless?\nDorothea: Ingrid, I...am trying to think of something polite to say right now. It's as if you have no experience dressing elegantly. At all.\nIngrid:\n(Phase 1) I mean...I don't. Dorothea, I appreciate you taking the time, but yes, you do have your work cut out for you.\n(Phase 2) I mean... I don't. Dorothea, I appreciate you taking the time, but yes, we're in the middle of a war. It hasn't been my top priority.\nDorothea: I'm sorry. I...I shouldn't be so hard on you. I was just surprised, is all. A gal like you? You're a beautiful young noblewoman... Who somehow has no experience with either makeup or fashion. This is basic stuff, Ingrid. The basics of the basics, really. But it's like you've never even tried.\nIngrid:\n(If Ingrid and Annette's B support is achieved) It may be basic for you, but I’m only just now learning. Annette has been taking the time to show me, actually.\nDorothea: Still, I can’t believe you didn’t know anything about it before her.\nIngrid: I was just never interested before. Even as a child, it never appealed to me. Fussy, pretty things always felt unnecessary. And gussying myself up to attract someone has never played an important part in my pursuits as a knight. But you've piqued my interest in all this.\nDorothea: How?\nIngrid: It's not like I'd be dressing myself up just to attract someone. I'd be dressing up for the occasion, specifically. Even if I don't dress up any other time, a special occasion such as this is a good reason to try it out.\nDorothea: Well, yeah. That's why we dress up when we go out. You might meet someone, and you want to look your best, don't you? Get their attention? Lure them in?\nIngrid: That's the exact opposite of what I just said. You said previously that dressing up for the occasion is reason enough.\nDorothea: Oh, I just said that so you wouldn't run off screaming.\nIngrid: I see.\nDorothea: My real point is that you're quite lovely even before getting all fixed up. Absolutely bewitching, in fact. So when I'm finished with you, well... Someone looking at you could be forgiven for...wanting to pounce.\nIngrid: Could they be? I don't know that I'd forgive them.\nDorothea: Oh, I know. That's just before I lunge, I'm gonna ask permission.\nIngrid: Permission is not granted–ever! Just back off._null_null_null_null_
14_29_Lorenz: Ah, Dorothea. Your beauty puts even the most pristine flower to shame.\nDorothea: Ah, Lorenz. As silver-tongued as ever.\nLorenz: Oh, not at all. I must bid you good day.\nDorothea: I see the rumors are true. What a shame.\nLorenz: Rumors? About me? Whatever do you mean?\nDorothea: Why, that you are always ready to flirt... Unless she's a commoner. Then you'll bid her good day as quickly as possible. Like you did with me just now. Are we so unpleasant to speak to, us commoners?\nLorenz: That is a rather, ah, pointed question. But I do happen to have an answer for you. As the heir to House Gloucester, I am in search of a bride of suitable status. The Alliance isn't fully unified. I require someone who will help bring it together.\nDorothea: I'd think you could find plenty of suitable women even among the masses.\nLorenz: Do not be so certain. A lady who marries me must be prepared to enter noble society, whether she wishes to or not. It is a complex web of etiquette and expectation. Not a world one could easily step into without the proper upbringing. What's more, House Gloucester would hardly see much benefit were I to join myself to the household of a commoner.\nDorothea: Oh, I can imagine. Well, I suppose that means any friendship between you and I is doomed as well.\nLorenz: Isn't that a rather excessive conclusion?\nDorothea: You want someone to birth your house's next generation. I want someone to share my life with. I'm not even an option in your eyes, and you are hardly viable in mine. However, we are all friends in here, are't we, so I suppose politeness, at the very least, is in order._Lorenz: Looking as lovely as ever today, Dorothea.\nDorothea: Oh, save it for your noble girls, Lorenz. I'm not in the mood.\nLorenz: I was only being polite.\nDorothea: And it really was quite wonderful to be so near your elegance. Now, if you'll please excuse me.\nLorenz: (irritated) Now hold just a moment! I have tolerated quite enough of this impertinence. Not a word has escaped my lips to imply that you are anything less than a highly attractive woman. But I am the heir to a noble house. I have a duty. Thus I am unable to engage in courtship with you. What is it about my circumstances that you seem to find so very amusing?\nDorothea: Um... all of it? You're no different from the men who flirted with me when I was in the opera. As long as you're getting what you're after, you don't much care what a woman wants, needs or feels.\nLorenz: That is truly what you think of me? I am afraid you have completely misunderstood.\nDorothea: Oh, have I? Do explain.\nLorenz: If noble status was my only priority, then I could be married a hundred times over by now. But birthright is not sufficient for me. I am not looking merely for an accessory. Marriage is a relationship of mutual respect, support, and trust. If my wife and I are of the same mind, and of the same worth, then together we can achieve anything. That is why I make overtures to so many ladies. I am in search of an ideal.\nDorothea: You're searching for someone who matches your vision of a perfect spouse? (chuckles) How odd. So am I. And everyone else.\nLorenz: My standards are somewhat more exacting, but yes, I suppose on that point we are similar. Please understand that I am acting with the best of intentions in search of a partner.\nDorothea: You're more serious than I thought. And so earnest... It's almost adorable. If you met a peasant girl and fell madly in love, would you be able to give her up? Break her heart?\nLorenz: I would have no choice. The worlds of the nobility and the common folk are simply too far apart. I cannot choose to abandon my duty merely for the sake of a fleeting emotion.\nDorothea: Lorenz, you are dangerously close to dedicating your life to the lie that nobility is something special... I hope you realize that before it's too late._Dorothea: Too much fighting. I need a moment's peace...\nLorenz: Why, if it isn't Dorothea.\nDorothea: What are you doing here?\nLorenz: Patrolling the grounds. There have been entirely too many raids as of late. And yourself?\nDorothea: Nothing. Not really. I just need a bit of quiet.\nLorenz: It is regrettable to see you so troubled by this war. This is not a burden any commoner should have to bear.\nDorothea: Don't trouble yourself on my account. So, did you ever find that wife you were looking for?\nLorenz: This is hardly the time or place for me to be searching for a bride. Why do you ask?\nDorothea: The truth is... I know this is sudden, but there's a war on, and who knows what tomorrow brings, right?\nLorenz: Go on.\nDorothea: I've always been quite fond of you. But I've also, well... I've given up on you.\nLorenz: That is... sudden. But why would you give up on me?\nDorothea: You're from a noble family, and I'm a commoner. It would have been scandalous. I did what I could to be worthy of you, but you never noticed... So I've resigned myself to a lonesome life, my feelings unrequited.\nLorenz: You found it so easy to give up on me? Truly? This war has changed my mind on a great many things, you know! I've given it all a lot of thought!\nDorothea: I like seeing you flustered, you know that? It makes joking with you so much more fun.\nLorenz: Joking?\nDorothea: Yes, joking. It used to be my job to pluck at people's heartstrings, remember? And I'm much better at it than you are. Admit it, Sir Lorenz.\nLorenz: Haha...hahaha. I concede defeat. But... But your words have cut straight through to my heart. And now I must tell you how I feel. I've always been charmed by you. I do not think I realized just how thoroughly until this moment.\nDorothea: You and I both know that doesn't matter. Not really. We can never get married.\nLorenz: Perhaps not now. I've not determined where I stand when it comes to marriage. But when this war is over, I will make a decision.\nDorothea: You will, huh? Gosh, I sure do hope I'm not already married by then.\nLorenz: Oh, that's hardly a concern. No one you find could possibly compare to me!_null_null_null_
14_20_Hanneman: Ahhh. Time to relax. \nDorothea: Professor Hanneman? Do you have a moment to talk? \nHanneman: Of course, of course, Miss Dorothea. Whatever is on your mind? \nDorothea: I heard you were once a member of the nobility, and you surrendered your title to come here. \nHanneman: Indeed, I was a noble once. Why are you so curious about that? \nDorothea: Ah, I knew there was something noble about your speech and your perfect manners. You're always impeccably dressed, too, and you have a certain pride about you. What interests me is that you threw it all away. Why?\nHanneman: I threw nothing away, child. In fact, by stepping away from its trappings, in my heart, I feel closer than ever to the true meaning of nobility. \nDorothea: How so? \nHanneman: Consider this. At its inception, the concept of nobility assumed that the greatest among the populace would rise to power. In my mind, I believe that those who value knowledge, those who strive for more, and wish to protect and guide their fellow man. However, in practice, nobility often serves to keep those deemed commoners down, segregated from those who, by chance, were born to a noble family. That is one of the reasons I decided to leave that nonsense behind, and dedicate myself to the study of Crests. Though I have abandoned my position, in my mind, it was to pursue what I consider to be a truly noble pursuit... That of knowledge. \nDorothea: I see. Well, you're definitely a noble in that sense of the word. To pursue such admirable ideas without regard for your social position... How wonderful. \nHanneman: Pardon? \nDorothea: Oh, it's nothing! I was just very moved by your words. \nHanneman: Ah! Well, I'm quite pleased to hear you say so._Dorothea: Professor Hanneman. How unexpected. \nHanneman: Hello, Miss Dorothea. There is something I would like to ask you, should you have a moment. \nDorothea: And whatever would that be, Professor? \nHanneman: Ah, it's just some rumor I heard. About your prejudice against the nobility. You remember when you came to me before, and we talked about how I used to be a noble? I was just wondering what your aim was. \nDorothea: To clarify, I only hate nobles who are obsessed with their status. You're not that kind of man, Professor. I mean that, really. And it sounds like you never were.\nHanneman: I see. But nobles obsessed with their status... You must have had some terrible experience in the past. Ah... My apologies. That was rather presumptuous. \nDorothea: No, it's fine. As I'm sure you know, I was a highly praised songstress for a time...  Before I was a singer though, I was an orphan. And before that I was the daughter of a noble's maid. \nHanneman: My goodness... From an orphan to a renowned songstress. That is quite a life you have led, Miss Dorothea. \nDorothea: Well, I don't remember much of my early years. My father was never there, and my mother was driven out of the noble house where she worked. Before long, she fell ill... I was always alone, and I lived in the alleys of the Imperial capital, just trying to survive from one day to the next.\nHanneman: I see... \nDorothea: Eventually, after I became a singer... I met the nobleman that I think is my father. \nHanneman: Oh? \nDorothea: He'd had a child with a maid, but the child didn't have a Crest... So he threw them both away. Those were his very words. I can't prove that he really was my father, but... I suppose it doesn't matter. He didn't know who I was, and when he flirted with me, my feelings were something beyond fury. I was dumbfounded. In truth, I felt that way about all of the nobles who flocked around me, yet would just as easily have tossed me away should it better suit them. \nHanneman: You have my most heartfelt of apologies, Dorothea. I am afraid my curiosity has opened old wounds. Sadly, it is undeniable that the nobility is full of such terrible people. Perhaps... even myself... \nDorothea: Professor? \nHanneman: Oh, it is nothing. Just lost in a memory of my own. Just know that I will do my part to ensure that you always know kindness in this world. \nDorothea: I... Thank you._Hanneman: Dorothea, my dear, you must be tired from the extended fighting. May I get you anything? \nDorothea: Thank you, Professor Hanneman, but I'm fine. \nHanneman: You don't appear fine. Make sure not to overexert yourself. The war is not yours alone to fight. You have friends to rely on. We are here for you, always. \nDorothea: Thank you, but I really am fine. It's nice to know you're always thinking of me though. \nHanneman: Well, of course. You're like a... \nDorothea: Like a what? \nHanneman: N-nothing... You're a very good friend. That's all. And once the war is over, I want to be sure you have a pleasant life. \nDorothea: Is that so? It sounds like you're getting a little ahead of yourself, planning for the end of the war.\nHanneman: Ahead of myself? No, I don't think so. \nDorothea: Oh? You sounded like you were building up the courage to give me something. Something, um, small and round and ring-shaped? \nHanneman: Huh? A ring you mean? Well, I... \nDorothea: Oh no. Am I wrong? I'm so embarrassed. I misunderstood. \nHanneman: Oh my! That's what you were thinking! I've misled you. I see now I phrased things all... Just all wrong. I had no other intentions, I swear. I'm sorry. Please forgive me.\nDorothea: I could forgive you... if you proposed properly. You got me excited, you know.\nHanneman: I... But I haven't... \nDorothea: It's OK. I'm just teasing. Don't look so scared. \nHanneman: Teasing. Ah. Well, of course. \nDorothea: It's nice just to know you care about me... Maybe we should talk more about the future... in the future. How's that sound? \nHanneman: Why, it sounds lovely. Quite lovely._null_null_null_
14_31_Dorothea: Professor Manuela! It's been far too long since we've had a proper chat. Let's fix that right now.\nManuela: Too true, Dorothea. We hardly have a moment to spare here. But it's nice to see you flourishing. It certainly brings back memories. You know, somehow you've gotten even prettier. The years have been kind to you.\nDorothea: That's something like a rose telling a daisy it's pretty, but I appreciate the compliment all the same.\nManuela: Ha! Oh, honey. If that's the case, I hope you'll work hard to never become a rose like me. Too many thorns.\nDorothea: Oh, stop it. You've accomplished a great deal. You should be proud.\nManuela: That's a very nice sentiment and I appreciate it. Thank you.\n(White Clouds) So, I've been dying to know, how did you come to be enrolled here?\n(Post Time Skip) So, I've been very curious, how did you end up enrolled at the academy, anyway?\nManuela: I know you didn't have any family connections. How'd you do it?\nDorothea: Well, it did require pulling some noble strings. But learning everything to pass the entrance exams? That was all me and very hard. Especially while I was still singing for the opera. But I wanted the academy more than anything else.\nManuela: Well, bravo and well-done. You've always had to find your own way in life, haven't you? I so wish you could rely on people more often... Still though, you haven't said why you worked so hard to get into Garreg Mach to begin with.\nDorothea: Isn't it obvious? Because you were here. When you retired, it broke my heart. But is also woke me up. Seeing someone like you, who shined so brightly on the stage, give it all up and start a brand new life... It got me thinking about my own future, and what I wanted it to look like. As ever, I followed your lead.\nManuela: Oh... Oh my. I... I don't know what to say.\nDorothea:\n(White Clouds) I had also heard that the heirs to the Alliance, Empire, and the Kingdom were all enrolling this year...\n(Post Time Skip) I had also heard that the heirs to the Alliance, Empire, and the Kingdom were all enrolling as well...\nDorothea: With such an exceptional crop of potential spouses, how could I go anywhere else?\nManuela: And have you gotten what you were after? Your dreams, a future... and a good partner?\nDorothea: I'm sure I'll find my somebody someday. But I haven't found them yet. Ahh, it's so nice to spend time with you again, Manuela. It's been too long._Manuela: Ughhh... My head is pounding. You'd think I'd get used to this... Ughh...\nDorothea: Manuela? Oh my goodness! You look terrible. Don't get up. I'll get you some water. I should fluff up those pillows for you. It will make you more comfortable.\nManuela: I'm completely hopeless.\nDorothea: ...\nManuela: I was so proud of being the reason you came to Garreg Mach. Dorothea wanted to follow in my footsteps! How great is that? I thought I'd use that as an inspiration to straighten myself out. Be less of a, you know, less of a disgrace. But here I am, right in front of you, dealing with the worst hangover I've had in weeks.\nDorothea: You thought you'd hide this from me?\nManuela: Wait, you mean you knew?\nDorothea: Even when you were still with the opera company, you had quite the reputation. There was a joke that you could outdrink a fish, and the sailor who caught it.\nManuela: Dorothea. My brain's pounding as it is. Please stop. It's all true, but I can't handle hearing it from you, the girl who I thought I had inspired to greatness. I can't believe I tried so hard to be a good example for you when you knew all along... I should leap into the ocean and drown.\nDorothea: Don't say that! You've not lost a bit of respect from me. Not one bit. Everyone has their faults, and some have more than others, but... You were the finest songstress the opera had ever seen. And you've taught me well. What I really mean to say is... You're my inspiration. I really do admire you.\nManuela: Thank you, Dorothea. That means a lot._Manuela: Dorothea? You look as if something's terribly wrong.\nDorothea: I do? Oh. Nothing's wrong. Not really. I just... I've just been thinking about the future... and what happens when the war is over.\nManuela: And tell me, what is your vision of the future like?\nDorothea: Well, I'm... not entirely sure. I guess I don't know what to expect. In my life, I've met all sorts of people who've lived lots of different way. So now I'm trying to figure out how I want to live. I'm free, unlike so many people. I have the ability to take control of my own fate. Like you.\nManuela: Ha, well... I quit the opera to join the Officers Academy as a professor... Then I joined this war because... I don't know. I'm hoping for an end to it. Peace for the world. Even though I took control of my own fate, I still haven't found the man of my dreams.\nDorothea: Haha, you'll find him. He's out there somewhere... You know, there is one thing I want for the future.\nManuela: So, you've got a dream after all?\nDorothea: Well, it's a dream I've always had. You'll think this is silly, but... I'd like to stand beside you.\nManuela: I don't get it.\nDorothea: When you left the opera company... I took your place. I stood center stage and sang. And everyone cheered for me. I wish the cheers were for me and you. I wish we stood on that stage together.\nManuela: I have to tell you something. The first time I saw you on stage, I felt you were the one I wanted to hear sing. I already had plans to leave the opera company, but when I met you... I knew I couldn't leave until I saw you take your rightful place. You're right though. It would have been nice to stand beside you on stage, even just once.\nDorothea: Maybe we weren't together then, but we're together here. Now. And, in the future, maybe it won't be so bad if you never find that man of your dreams.\nManuela: What do you mean by that?\nDorothea: You and me. I won't find a guy either, we can just be together. I think that'd be pretty nice, don't you? Living together, and doing whatever we want.\nManuela: Huh. You know... That could be nice. It'd be like you and me, finally together on stage... The light shining down, our gowns and jewels sparkling. Just us...\nDorothea: Sparkling in the stage lights forever._null_null_null_
14_40_Dorothea: It's time I fessed up, Yurikins. I saw the whole thing.\nYuri: What was it you think you saw?\nDorothea: It looked like you were singing to the children in the alley out back. And may I say, you were fantastic. Your performance hit me right in the heart. That was a song from Mittelfrank's Imperial capital show, right? Ah, the good old days. You must have come back night after night if you remember it that well.\nYuri: Perhaps a few times... I remember well how you looked upon that stage. You were the talk of the capital among all the nobles. Unsurpassable? Yes, that was it. It's hard to believe I'd run into that unsurpassable songstress in a place like this. Hm. Luck is on my side, as ever.\nDorothea: I couldn't convince you to sing tenor yourself, hm? You're talented enough for it.\nYuri: What are you getting at? Is this an invitation from the Mystical Songstress herself?\nDorothea: Male virtuosos are hard to come by. Would-be divas are a dime a dozen, but men? Not so much. And they have to be talented. As good as I am, which is very talented indeed. I think you have what it takes. If you're interested, I can-\nYuri: Sorry, but no. No way in hell am I ever doing that.\nDorothea: Goodness. You could have stopped at ''no.''\nYuri: I can't think of anything more wretched than getting up on stage to sing in front of a bunch of people.\nDorothea: You didn't seem to mind singing for those children.\nYuri: The little ones weren't feeling well and couldn't sleep, so I sang them a lullaby to help. That's a far cry from standing on the same stage as you have with all those stuffy nobles staring at me. Truthfully? I'm not brave enough for it.\nDorothea: Rein it in, Yurikins. It's the opera, not the battlefield. This isn't a life or death situation.\nYuri: Heh heh... Fair enough. Sometimes I forget what's a real threat and what isn't. But I must ask you never to bring up singing again. Not to me. Not if you want to keep things amicable between us.\nDorothea: How can someone so good at singing hate it so much?_Dorothea: Nice to see you, Yurikins. I was wondering if you might do me a favor.\nYuri: You're looking a bit serious, ladybird. Oh... your foot. What happened?\nDorothea: It's healing nicely, but I'm not supposed to put too much weight on it.\nYuri: Ah, so that's why you've called me here. What do you need? Help with errands?\nDorothea: Not an errand. An opera.\nYuri: I see.\nDorothea: There's been some loose plans for a performance. Nothing professional, strictly volunteer. I signed up to take part as one of the main roles. And then this happened. The professor told me I should bow out, just to be on the safe side.\nYuri: Makes sense to stay off your feet while you heal. Meanwhile, you want me to fill your role, right?\nDorothea: Got it in one! I'm glad we're on the same page here.\nYuri: Surely someone else is up to the task. Professor Manuela for example...\nDorothea: Already tried. Trust me, I wouldn't ask unless I was desperate. I knew how much you'd hate the idea.\nYuri: Aside from hating it, I also wouldn't remotely sound like you do.\nDorothea: Oh, don't worry about that. Most of our audience won't be able to tell the difference. The crowd's going to be a bunch of down-on-their-luck children that the monastery's taken in. I'm only talking about a small festival in the plaza. We want to give them a good show, that's all. You have an idea of what they've been through. I thought you might want to pitch in.\nYuri: Mm-hmm... I hear your angle. Fine, fine, yes. I'll do it.\nDorothea: Good for you. I knew you'd rise to the occasion.\nYuri: You certainly know how to pull on heartstrings to get your way, don't you? Where did you learn to do that, anyway? The opera?\nDorothea: Could be! I've never known a songstress who wasn't both beautiful and resourceful. Now, are you ready to go over the libretto? You've got a lot of rehearsing to do before the performance. Seriously, though... Thanks, Yurikins.\nYuri: Yeah, yeah, yeah._Dorothea: All right, Yurikins. Isn't it about time you let go of this grudge?\nYuri: ...\nDorothea: I'm sorry I dragged you out onto the stage, but I can't believe you're still holding it against me.\nYuri: I bear no grudge.\nDorothea: Then why do you get this stony look and face the other way any time you catch a glimpse of me?\nYuri: ... Oh, ladybird. Truth be told, when I see you, it reminds me of my own self-loathing... of my past.\nDorothea: Huh. I didn't know you were carrying something like that.\nYuri: You rose up from your hardship and became the lead singer for a prestigious opera, all on your own. While I made my way through the world by licking the boots of wretched nobles, watching you on stage from the sidelines. It wasn't until recently that I felt a real sense of accomplishment in my life. But recalling that first pivotal moment when I saw you on stage... You were brilliant. You shone like nothing I'd ever seen. Whenever I see you, ladybird, I'm reminded of that moment. And in that moment, I had never felt so filthy and unlovable in all my life.\nDorothea: That's why you don't like singing? There's got to be more to it than that.\nYuri: Back then, the Imperial capital was swarming with disgusting nobles, all of them vying for your attention- for the love of the Dorothea. Many were willing to compromise with an inferior substitute. If they couldn't have you, perhaps someone else was capable of singing just as sweetly.\nDorothea: You do what you must to chase your dreams. You say it left you filthy and unlovable, but my life didn't leave me unscathed either. There's not much love left in what I do. There was one, of course. As a child, I lived for singing. No matter how hard times got, I always had that. I counted myself so lucky to have met Manuela and joined the opera. But the more I sang for a living, the less certain I was that I loved it anymore.\nYuri: You're a tricky one to assess. I can't tell if you're too wise or too naive for your own good. Whether or not your heart's in it now, you certainly didn't appear to hate it back then. I'd never seen you beam so... brightly... as you did when you helped me train for the performance.\nDorothea: You might be onto something. I felt... genuinely happy in that moment.\nYuri: You just lost your spark for singing. Nothing more. It's how I feel about it, in a way. How about this. Why not join an opera that doesn't have dealings with nobles?\nDorothea: That's... a great idea, actually. We'll start something new together. You and me.\nYuri: I don't know about all that, now...\nDorothea: The world is full of people who fell through the cracks, just like us. We'll take them in whenever we can and aim to become Fodlan's premier opera company. I can't remember the last time I was this fired up! Though we'll have to table it until after the war.\nYuri: Hm... Our own one-of-a-kind traveling opera. You know, that does sound fairly thrilling. I've no doubts it could help deepen our pockets.\nDorothea: Leave it to you to take all the romance out of it! But I know you're an idealist deep down.\nYuri: Takes one to know one! I must say, I do enjoy seeing your mischievous side at work.\nDorothea: I'll take that as a compliment. I could say the same for you too. It's exactly why I'm comfortable sharing this dream with you._null_null_null_
