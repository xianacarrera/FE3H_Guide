16_41_Felix: I thought I heard someone. Are you here to train?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Yes.\nChoice 2: No, just watching.\nFelix: Care to train with me? Waving this sword around alone is boring. And I'm tired of crossing swords with worthless opponents. But you seem like a worthy adversary.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sure, why not?\nChoice 2: You think I'm a worthy adversary?\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: I've always been interested in your technique.\nChoice 2 response: I don't know for certain, but you seem skilled. I've always been interested in your technique.\nFelix: You learned from the former captain of the Knights of Seiros, and traveled Fódlan fighting as a mercenary. Good sparring partners like you don't grow on trees. But know that I will beat you, and I will surpass your strength.\nByleth: Why are you so focused on becoming stronger?\nFelix: Why? Hm. I never really thought about that. I learned to thrust a sword before I learned to write my name. Of course, my upbringing wasn't unique. That's how it is for all children in my country. You're of no use if you can't swing a sword, however mighty your Crest may be. It was the perfect environment for me. I could live free of stodgy values and virtues. Grow strong so you may live, and live to grow stronger. That's what I was taught.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Do you have any other ambitions?\nChoice 2: You remind me of myself.\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: Why should I? Nothing's as important as the pursuit of strength.\nChoice 2 response: Now I'm intrigued by your fighting style, and by who you really are...\nFelix: But that's enough idle chatter. Take out your sword. My mind is emptied of all but the thrill of the challenge!_Felix: You're certainly not going easy on me. You fight like a mercenary, not a knight. You hunger for victory, pure and simple. You may not be aware of it yourself, but I see it.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Should I take that as a compliment?\nChoice 2: Should I take that as a criticism?\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: Indeed.\nChoice 2 response: No.\nFelix: Knights ought to have some hunger. I've always thought so. They depend too much on their swords. Only when they're wrested away do knights consider their hands and feet as weapons. That's not how it was for warriors of old. They weren't limited by their tools. Victory is what matters, not the method of achieving it. That's the attitude to adopt. I detect that in your style. It is plain to see.\nByleth: That doesn't seem like praise...\nFelix: You may take it however you like. I believe the difference between us lies within that hunger. But where does it come from? From the start, I was aiming to win, yet I couldn't defeat you. Then I remembered something you said before...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: About your aspirations?\nChoice 1: About your upbringing?\nFelix: Indeed. I was raised to value strength above all else. Whereas you had a reason, an ambition, pushing you toward that hunger. So, tell me. What was the reason? Why were you driven to become so strong?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: To survive.\nChoice 2: To protect the people of Fódlan.\nChoice 3 (Part II only): To stop this war.\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: That's a mercenary's answer, to be sure.\nChoice 2/3 response: Hah! Spoken like a knight. That's not what I would have expected.\nFelix: So that is the source of your hunger. I suppose I must find my own.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'll help you.\nChoice 2: We can find it together.\nFelix: Ah, if we're to get along, I think not. I'll be content if you continue to train with me. Perhaps it will come to me as I swing my sword._Felix: Finally, I notched a win against you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You crushed me.\nChoice 2: I almost had you.\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: Oh, please. I scraped by.\nChoice 2 response: True. It was a narrow victory.\nFelix: When we spar, I feel like I’m revisiting my past.\nByleth: Why?\nFelix: It’s like training with my brother. He always won—always—and died before I could win a single bout. From the first time I held a sword, all I wanted was to surpass him. And that’s what drove me to become so strong. Perhaps it’s absurd to say such a thing, but… I’ve spent all these years training for a duel with a corpse.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It’s not absurd.\nChoice 2: You found an answer to my question.\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: Perhaps not.\nChoice 2 response: Yes. I suppose I did.\nFelix: I can never again spar with my brother. Not unless he climbs out of his grave. Still, I continue my endless pursuit of strength. Maybe because I have a new opponent to measure myself against.\nByleth: Who?\nFelix: You. Obviously. I beat you this time, but when we next cross swords, who knows what might happen? It was a close match, not a crushing victory. I know that I can do better. I will surpass you in strength, and then I’ll become stronger still.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: And then?\nChoice 2: Don’t count me out yet.\nFelix:\nChoice 1 response: And then, when this war is over, I won’t have as many chances to swing my sword. I can hardly imagine that.\nChoice 2 response: Ha. Just what I was hoping you’d say.\nFelix: Anyway, thank you...for helping me find an answer to the question you asked, all those years ago._null_null_null_

Take this.\n(Felix gives Byleth a ring)\n\nByleth: Felix...\nFelix: Without a worthy opponent like you at my side, not only will my sword grow dull...it'll rust. So I had to think of a way to make sure you'd always be with me. This is what I came up with. And...\nByleth: And?\nFelix: You're pretty slow on the uptake. Don't you know what this ring means?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No, I don't.\nChoice 2: I want to hear you say it.\nFelix: If you keep messing around, I'll... I'll... Fine! Listen carefully. I'm not going to say this more than once. I want you to be my wife. Please say yes. Let's get married and stay together until we die. I love you.\nFelix: ...\nFelix: That's all.\n(Felix turns to leave)\n\nByleth: Wait!\nFelix: What? You have something to complain about?\nByleth: I love you too, and I accept.\nFelix: Oh... OK, then. In that case, I'd better start planning for the future. My future...with you.
16_39_Sylvain: Hey, Felix, you free? You don't look very busy. Let's go find some girls to chat with.\nFelix: Chat with them by yourself. You're interrupting my training.\nSylvain: Hey, come on. Don't talk like that. How long have we known each other?\nFelix: Long enough, if you ask me. We only know each other because of our parents' friendship. I didn't have a say in it.\nSylvain: Is that how it went? Huh. I remember it more like you always following me around. Whenever there was something wrong—like you lost to your brother or you fought with Dimitri—you'd come crying to me. You were so meek and pure back then, cute even... like a baby brother.\nFelix: That's enough.\nSylvain: What?\nFelix: I said, \"That's enough.\"\nSylvain: Hey! Sorry. I just came to see if you wanted to pick up some girls. I didn't mean to get on your nerves.\nFelix: Look. You've been getting on my nerves for years. I've tried to be patient with you, but I'm tired of holding my tongue. You're reckless in your personal affairs and in battle. And you're always prattling on about women!\nSylvain: Well, if a man sees a pretty girl, he can't just let her pass by without commenting. That's just rude.\nFelix: You're insatiable. Do you ever stop? Certainly not to practice your sword technique. You always skip training. And you never consider how your actions hurt others...or how you hold them back.\nSylvain: That's never my intention. Come on, you know me better than that. I'm not really— Look, if that's the impression I've given you, then I'm sorry.\nFelix: Hmph._Felix: Sylvain. I want to apologize for the other day.\nSylvain: The other day? What are you talking about, Felix? Is this a trap?\nFelix: You know...when I called you \"insatiable.\"\nSylvain: Oh, that? Can't say it didn't hurt, but you have nothing to apologize for. I mean, you've said worse, Felix. Considerably worse. Come on, we've known each other since we were kids. We're not going to let your constant verbal abuse get in the way of our friendship, are we?\nFelix: No, I suppose not.\nSylvain: Whenever I started doing something dumb, you'd yell at me about it.\nFelix: And whenever you dragged me into something, Ingrid would find out and start lecturing us.\nSylvain: All these years and not much has changed, has it? But you're different, Felix. You used to be so, I don't know...carefree when we were young. Now you're the exact opposite.\nFelix: Well, you're not any different. Good-for-nothing then. Good-for-nothing now.\nSylvain: Again with the abuse! This from the guy who's always been by that good-for-nothing's side. So did you come to apologize or to insult me?\nFelix: I was on my way to train and I saw you. That's all.\nSylvain: You're off to train? Again? Now who's insatiable?\nFelix: Better than sitting idle like you.\nSylvain: A little idleness would do you some good, pal. Come on. Let me buy you something to eat.\nFelix: No.\nSylvain: You have to choose, Felix. Our friendship, or your training.\nFelix: My training. Good-bye for now.\n(Felix leaves, and Sylvain chases after him)\n\nSylvain: What did— Is he— Wait, Felix! I'll come train too. Wait up!_Felix: Sylvain. Eat these.\nSylvain: What are \"these,\" Felix? Oh, hey, is this candy?\nFelix: A girl in town gave them to me, but I don't want them.\nSylvain: Right, you don't like sweet stuff. Thanks, I'll eat them later. So, what do you need? Want me to help you get closer to a girl? Just point her out.\nFelix: You're incorrigible. No. I wanted to thank you for your help in battle. If you hadn't spotted that enemy ambush, I would have been killed.\nSylvain: Nah, I didn't do anything special. Friends help each other out, especially on the battlefield. Just a little give and take, ya know?\nFelix: You never change.\nSylvain: Nope. I try to stay on an even keel.\nFelix: You're always...\nSylvain: Always what?\nFelix: Nothing.\nSylvain: Come on. If you've got something on your mind, then say it.\nFelix: Maybe I'll tell you later. Maybe I won't.\nSylvain: Fair enough. I'll be having something to eat while you're deciding...whatever it is you're deciding. Actually, come with me. My treat. If you do want to talk, then I'm right there.\nFelix: OK, just this once. Only because you saved my life.\nSylvain: Free food, possible conversation, and when we're done, we can find some girls.\nFelix: …\n(Felix leaves)\n\nSylvain: It was a joke! Felix, I was joking! Come on, let's just go eat.\n(Sylvain chases after him)_(Sylvain convalescing in his room)\n\nFelix: Sylvain.\nSylvain: (Off screen) Hey, Felix. I'm glad you're safe.\nFelix: You irresponsible fool! Protecting me like that. You're so weak, and yet you always...always...\nSylvain: (Off screen) Look, it doesn't matter, as long as you're safe. You can go on living, while I...\nFelix: Stop kidding around. You're not going to die. I won't let you.\n(Felix enters Sylvain's room)\n\nSylvain: Heh heh... Nah, I won't die on you. I promise. You think something like this could kill me? No way. A little magic will take care of the wound. Some bed rest then I'm good to go out and do it all over again.\nFelix: Sylvain!\nSylvain: Oh, come on. That was funny. It's not like you to be so concerned.\nFelix: You really are a fool. The biggest in all of Fódlan. I thought something was off. There's no way you could die from such a small cut. You're so reckless and inattentive, I thought this might be divine punishment.\nSylvain: Hey! That's not nice! You should be thanking me.\nFelix: I am grateful. You've been doing this ever since we were children. Constantly fooling around, but then showing up and helping when we really need you. I'll admit, seeing that smile on your face, I almost want to give you a hug. Almost.\nSylvain: A hug? Did you get hit on the head? Come on. Tell me you want to hug me again. I liked it.\nFelix: Hmph! I won't be repeating it, you half-wit. You're obviously fine, so I'll leave now.\n(Felix turns to leave)\n\nSylvain: You know how we grew up together?\nFelix: Obviously.\nSylvain: Do you remember the promise we made when we were kids? About sticking together until we die together?\nFelix: I remember.\nSylvain: Well, I'm really not trying to get myself killed before you. You know that, right?\nFelix: I know... I know. But I'm tired of these close calls. You have to stop fooling around. Take your training more seriously. You can die whenever you please, but I'm not going down with you.\nSylvain: OK, I get it. Once I've healed, I'll get my act together.\nFelix: Hmph. Then I hope you have a speedy recovery.\n(Felix leaves)\n\nFelix: (Off screen) Sylvain? Thank you.\nSylvain: That's what friends are for, Felix._A+_null_
16_33_Mercedes: Here you go, Felix. Have some tea.\nFelix: Oh. Hm.\nMercedes: Sorry, but we're all out of cakes. Should I bake some more?\nFelix: Please don't.\nMercedes: Oh, your clothes are so dirty! Let me wash them for you.\nFelix: Mercedes, what's wrong with you?\nMercedes: There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just making tea. Is there something wrong with that?\nFelix: You're not my mother. You don't have to bother with all this. I can do without it.\nMercedes: I...I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to be rude. You just remind me so much of my little brother...\n(if The Face Beneath paralogue was not completed)\n\nFelix: I do?\nMercedes: Yes. His name was Emile. We have different fathers, but we grew up in the same household. That is, until I was about eight or nine years old. I haven't seen him since then...\n(if The Face Beneath paralogue was completed)\n\nFelix: Your brother is Jeritza, the Death Knight.\nMercedes: Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying you remind me of the Death Knight or Jeritza. Just...Emile.\nFelix: But they're the same person.\n(The dialogue branches back to this point)\n\nFelix: Sorry to state the obvious, but I'm not your brother. I'm not Emile. Can't you find someone else to bother?\nMercedes: Oh! I'm so sorry. I'll leave you alone. Please, help yourself to more tea if you'd like. I can leave the pot. Good-bye.\n(Mercedes leaves)\n\nFelix: I am me—Felix Hugo Fraldarius. There is no one else. Brother..._Felix: Here you are.\nMercedes: Oh! Were you looking for me, Felix?\nFelix: You were injured in the last battle. Are you OK?\nMercedes: I'm fine now. Thank you for your concern.\nFelix: You really are troublesome.\nMercedes: I'm so sorry. I didn't want to get in your way out there... I just couldn't help but worry! I was only trying to keep an eye on you...\nFelix: What are you even doing on the battlefield? You endangered yourself and got hurt. Such a stupid thing to do.\nMercedes: Yes, of course. You're right. I have no excuses.\nFelix: If you intend to carry on being such a fool, you'd best stay near me.\nMercedes: Are you sure? I'd hate to get in your way again.\nFelix: You can, um...\nMercedes: Hmm?\nFelix: You can keep thinking of me as your little brother. That'd be better than going through this again.\nMercedes: But I thought you didn't like that. Didn't you say you were fed up with it?\nFelix: I am fed up with it. I've already spent years filling in for someone who's dead. My older brother inspired love and respect—he was a great knight. He died. Since his death, his memory has followed me around like a shadow.\nMercedes: Oh... I didn't know you had a brother too...\nFelix: Hmph. I don't let my personal feelings distract me on the battlefield. Still, do I really remind you of him?\nMercedes: Well, you don't look like him, but something about you feels so familiar. It just makes me want to protect you. That's not to say that you're incapable or unreliable or anything like that... In fact, it's quite the opposite. You're the one who just came to check on me.\nFelix: You need to pay attention to your surroundings. You're reckless. Lives are at stake. Including mine, when I have to run over and save your skin.\nMercedes: Yes, I'll try to be more careful. Thank you for being so kind, Felix.\nFelix: Whatever._Felix: ...\nMercedes: ...\nFelix: Do you need something? Let's hear it.\nMercedes: Oh, no, I don't need anything. I was just hoping to talk to you, Felix.\nFelix: When I said you could be near me, I meant on the battlefield. You're pushing it a little too far. You'd better not start calling me \"Emile.\"\nMercedes: You know, I'm not just using you as a stand-in for my brother. I don't mean to upset you... But I've come to realize that you two don't have that much in common after all.\nFelix: I don't understand. Why are you hanging around me, if not to replace your brother?\nMercedes: It's not that I want to be near Emile, but I want to be near you.\nFelix: What?\nMercedes: How embarrassing! It must sound like I'm coming on to you! Regardless, you've made it clear that you don't want me around.\nFelix: Um, no. It's not that.\nMercedes: Good! Then I'll continue to spend time at your side!\nFelix: What a perplexing creature.\nMercedes: What's that? Did you say something? Never mind that. Why don't we go out for a nice cup of tea?\nFelix: I can't think of a reason to refuse your invitation, so I suppose I have to accept._null_null_null_
16_25_Ingrid: Felix, there you are. I've been looking all over for you.\n(Part 1) Time for our tactics lecture. You'll be there, won't you?\n(Part 2) The war council congregates soon. You'd better come.\nFelix:\n(Part 1) Those things are such a waste of time.\n(Part 2) Not sure why you need me. I don't know the first thing about strategy—just how to use a sword.\nIngrid: Nonsense. You're going to be there.\nFelix: Must I?\nIngrid: Why is this such a chore? You went last time. Though you did all you could to disrupt things, as I recall. Brazenly rambling on about clear-cutting a nearby forest to secure a marching route. And attacking an enemy base, stealing their horses. You were incredibly disruptive and even rude.\nFelix: I was offering my honest opinion.\nIngrid: Then, you left before we were finished! What do you suppose happened after that?\nFelix: I have no idea.\nIngrid: Well, the conversation got quite lively. We all began breaking down the viability of your somewhat maniacal plan. And apparently, similar tactics have been used to turn the tides of historic battles.\nFelix: That may be an exaggeration. Successful armies must be able to handle unexpected situations. That starts with weapon mastery and creative tactics.\nIngrid: If you didn't have so much battlefield experience, you wouldn't be capable of such unique strategies. Which is why we need people like you—people who think creatively—to lead the army.\nFelix: Now you're just massaging my ego.\nIngrid: When have you ever minded? We need you there. Just come on.\nFelix: Mm-hmm._Ingrid: …\n(Felix enters)\n\nFelix: Hello.\nIngrid: Oh, hello. Have you been there long? I was absorbed in this book.\nFelix: Another silly legend?\nIngrid: First of all, they're not silly. And second of all, no. It's an essay that speaks to uncommon and challenging battle scenarios. I've been researching such things since you proposed your unique strategy. Listen to this—\"Your commander gives orders that put your hometown in extreme danger. Do you carry out the order or protect your hometown?\"\nFelix: What nonsense. I was talking about real-world tactics, not some dumb ethical question.\nIngrid: Whatever your personal feelings on the matter, I see similarities between such tactics and these \"dumb\" ethical questions. I haven't read beyond this one, but I think the obvious answer is to follow your commander.\nFelix: ...\nIngrid: The duty and pride of being a knight demand that you follow orders, regardless of your own feelings. But if I were put in such a position, I don't know how I'd fare... In fact, were someone to carry out those orders, I know that I'd attempt to stop them.\nFelix: Stop bothering with all this. You're not meant to be a knight. Go find a husband.\nIngrid: Excuse me?\nFelix: You heard me.\nIngrid: I know you hate the ideals of chivalry and pride. So much so, you prefer to escape your duty as your family's heir. You have no right to criticize me for my ideals.\nFelix: Perhaps not. At least I know not to heedlessly obey orders. I know not to romanticize blind obedience. My brother taught me to think for myself.\nIngrid: Don't you dare bring Glenn into this...\nFelix: You're right. Forget it._Ingrid: Why are you taking over my cleaning responsibilities?\nFelix: You're wounded, and you're going too slowly. I couldn't stand to watch.\nIngrid: You're still fretting over me, are you? I'm fine now, really. It wasn't even serious.\nFelix: I could have handled the situation alone. That enemy wasn't much of a threat.\nIngrid: Yes, yes, we all know you could've. But I also didn't want to risk something unforeseen befalling you. I've been doing some thinking. I feel a bit lost—I don't know that I'm cut out to be a knight after all. Without fulfilling that dream—without being a knight—I've been asking myself where my place is in the world. And I think... I think I've found my answer. I don't want to lose anyone anymore. So I want to protect those I hold dear.\nFelix: That's why you were protecting me, huh? What a fool you are.\nIngrid: Foolish to act in line with what I value most? Were I to die, I would die knowing I followed my heart—my truest calling. I've been reading through more of that book I was telling you about. Recall the hypothetical question posed? \"Do you carry out the orders or protect your hometown?\"\nFelix: You've been reading that garbage again?\nIngrid: The book never specified that one should prioritize the commander's orders. Instead it suggested that one should follow their heart in the matter. That's what a knight—that's what anyone being true to themselves—should do.\nFelix: That's just the editor's opinion.\nIngrid: Of course. And I find value in that opinion. Glenn died following his heart. Not heeding the commands of the country or even the royal family. I will follow his example. No matter the outcome, no matter the circumstance, I believe in myself.\nFelix: Hmph! You know nothing.\nIngrid: What is it that you known, then? What is it you fight for, Felix?\nFelix: My own beliefs.\nIngrid: I see no difference from my own stance.\nFelix: You don't understand.\nIngrid: You fight to be stronger than everyone, that you might protect those you care for. Correct?\nFelix: OK, fine, you do understand. My point is, don't let this happen again. If you died, I'd be...annoyed.\nIngrid: To avoid annoyance, then, I suggest you continue to grow stronger. If that happens, I might allow you to protect me too.\nFelix: You're insufferable._null_null_null_
16_30_Lysithea: Mmmm...yum. Mmmm... Ahh, so delicious! I'm so content in this moment.\n(Felix enters)\n\nFelix: ...\nLysithea: Felix!\nFelix: Lysithea. You look mortified.\nLysithea: How long have you been there? Were you watching me? You were, weren't you?\nFelix: I was, yes.\nLysithea: Ugh, for once I thought I had some privacy.\nFelix: Did you say something?\nLysithea: Huh? Nope. Didn't say anything at all. Here.\nFelix: What's this for?\nLysithea: I'm buying your silence...with cake. Take it.\nFelix: I'm not sure what to be silent about.\nLysithea: If people knew I was shoveling cake into my face by the fistful, they'd think me nothing more than a child!\nFelix: Adults eat cake.\nLysithea: You'll never understand. Just take this, will you?!\nFelix: No. I don't like sweets.\nLysithea: Does your refusal mean you'll be telling everyone about my cake-shoveling ways?\nFelix: I just don't like sweets, that's all.\nLysithea: Nonsense! Nobody can resist something so delicious. Look, I'm giving you this cake whether you like it or not. Eat it, toss it, throw it at an unsuspecting victim—the choice is yours. Just please don't mention this to anyone.\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nFelix: What was her problem? And what am I supposed to do with this cake?_Lysithea: Mmmm! Ahh yes! These are the moments I live for!\n(Felix enters)\n\nFelix: I don't understand you.\nLysithea: You again?! Can't you see I'm busy?\nFelix: Trust me, I didn't mean to interrupt.\nLysithea: So, how did you like the cake? I bet you ate it, didn't you? I knew it was irresistible. What was the experience like? I'm curious, from a research perspective.\nFelix: I don't know. I didn't eat it. I gave it to some kid.\nLysithea: You...gave it to some...undeserving child?!\nFelix: We've been over this. I don't like sweets.\nLysithea: Cake is not a \"sweet.\" Cake is the divine essence of the heavens!\nFelix: Everyone has their own tastes.\nLysithea: That's true, but life without cake is no life at all. Your divisiveness regarding cake is inexcusable.\nFelix: I'm not sure why you're so fixated on this.\nLysithea: I simply can't resist the spongy magnificence of cakes. I don't understand how you can be so dispassionate about it.\nFelix: I don't know. I just don't like it.\nLysithea: Just try a bite. Come on. Open up!\nFelix: No. I already told you, I don't want it.\nLysithea: But I made this one. With care and attention—love even. Ah, and I went light on the sugar, just for you!\nFelix: Not light enough, I'd bet. If I eat this, will you stop bothering me?\nLysithea: More or less. Just don't give it to some silly child this time.\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nFelix: Let's get this over with._Lysithea: Felix! I've awaited this fated day!\nFelix: You don't change. Still prattling on about it.\nLysithea: Aw, come on. I just wanted to hear what you thought of the cake I gave you.\nFelix: Uh... It was edible.\nLysithea: If by edible you mean incredible, then yes! I agree.\nFelix: It was satisfying and lightweight. I imagine it would be quite useful as a battlefield provision.\nLysithea: Please refrain from lumping delectable cake into the same category as provisions.\nFelix: You're upset and I don't understand why. I'm complimenting the cake. You cured my dislike of sweets. For that I thank you.\nLysithea: You have an interesting way of giving compliments, but I'm glad you liked it.\nFelix: Yes. Got any cakes on you?\nLysithea: You say that as thought I just carry cake on me at all times! Did you want some?\nFelix: That's not what I meant. If you've baked a cake, however, I wouldn't object to eating a slice.\nLysithea: If cake is what you want, you can just ask me directly. It just so happens I have a brand-new recipe I tried out, special for you. It's delicious and not overly sweet. Perfect for you.\nFelix: OK.\nLysithea: Go on—take a bite!\nFelix: Mmm.\nLysithea: You love it! I can tell. Here, try this one out too!\nFelix: Mmm.\nLysithea: See! So amazing, huh? Just keep working on that sweet tooth of yours. Then we can share cake notes and eat cake together all the time. That is... It just sounds nice is all.\nFelix: Mmm? OK. That does sound nice._null_null_null_
16_27_Felix: If you don't have any business here, go away. You're bothering me.\nLeonie: Finally spotted me, did you?\nFelix: What do you want?\nLeonie: They say you're the best. I wanted to see your training with my own eyes.\nFelix: Hmph. Spying on people, is that a hobby of yours? I hope you got your fill.\nLeonie: Enough to see how to beat you, at least.\nFelix: You think you can beat me?\nLeonie: That's right. See, I was trained by...\nFelix: Jeralt, yes.\nLeonie: So you know.\nFelix: I heard he was your teacher. Perhaps we should test you—see how much of your training sank in.\nLeonie: I'm ready if you are.\nFelix: OK. I'll give you a chance.\nLeonie: Sounds good. When?\nFelix: I'll let you know. In the meantime, practice. I won't go easy on you.\nLeonie: Oh, don't worry. I'll be ready.\n(Leonie leaves)\n\nFelix: This will be fun._Leonie: Sorry to keep you waiting.\nFelix: How long did you expect me to stand here?\nLeonie: I did just say sorry, but I could say the same to you. You were pretty slow to settle on a time.\nFelix: I can't help having a busy schedule. Plus, I thought you could use the extra time to prepare.\nLeonie: We could go back and forth like this all day. Or we could get started.\nFelix: Hmph. You were the one who kept me waiting. Let's begin.\nLeonie: On my signal?\nFelix: Hurry up.\n(screen fades to black)\n\nLeonie: That's better. OK, go!\nFelix: Let's see what you— Huh?! Aaaaargh! A pit trap?\nLeonie: That's right! How you feelin' down there?\nFelix: Coward!\nLeonie: Say what you want, but Captain Jeralt taught me this one!\n(screen fades back in)\n\nLeonie: Whew! You're heavier than you look.\nFelix: I'll admit, I wasn't expecting that.\nLeonie: If this were for real, you'd be dead. Aren't you glad I put straw down there, instead of spikes?\nFelix: Yes. I underestimated you. I suppose your lateness was a ploy to distract me.\nLeonie: You're not wrong. I did it to rile you up...draw you in. You're capable, confident... I was counting on that. So, what do you think about Captain Jeralt's training now?\nFelix: His technique worked, and you won. What else is there to say? Winning is all that matters. You drew my attention to a major vulnerability. I'll need to be wary of traps. Thank you, Leonie.\nLeonie: Seeing as you're thanking me, can I ask you a favor? Will you come watch my next training session? I'd like a few pointers about fighting in close quarters.\nFelix: The loser must pay tribute, I suppose. Yes, I'll help you train.\nLeonie: You will? Thanks!_Felix: And that's how it's done.\nLeonie: Good to know. There are so many differences between bows and blades!\nFelix: Yes. You're a quick learner, Leonie, and quite a good teacher as well.\nLeonie: Must be Captain Jeralt's influence. The weather, the terrain, the enemy's feelings—you have to find ways to make it all work for you.\nFelix: I agree. A warrior can't stick too closely to predefined tactics. That's quite shrewd. You're impressive for a girl.\nLeonie: For a girl? Come on, you're past that. Looking down on your opponent is a great way to fall into a pit trap, isn't it?\nFelix: I suppose that's true.\nLeonie: Glad you remember.\nFelix: I still have much to learn. Not only about swordplay, but also about thinking on my feet. I hope to learn more from you, Leonie.\nLeonie: Count on it! We'll come up with plenty of new ideas if we work together. Guess that means we're partners, doesn't it?\nFelix: We're what?\nLeonie: Partners! Friends who help each other improve!\nFelix: Hm. Partners. That's not bad.\nLeonie: Not at all! Looking forward to working with you, partner!\nFelix: Likewise...partner._null_null_null_
16_37_Felix: May I help you, Seteth?\nSeteth: Finally noticed me, I see. Good to see that you are so dedicated to your training.\nFelix: Do you have need of my sword?\nSeteth: No, this is not a military matter. I would like to discuss the distance you seem to be keeping from the others.\nFelix: \"Distance\"? I don't follow.\nSeteth: I have noticed that you like to keep other at arm's length. And in most cases, quite a bit further.\nFelix: Hmph. Keeping a close eye on me. They don't share my values. That's all.\nSeteth: Is that why you train alone? Because your friends do not share your values?\nFelix: You seem displeased. I suppose you're going to tell me, \"To defeat your enemies, you must have dependable allies.\"\nSeteth: That's not exactly how I would phrase it, but having good relationships with your allies is essential in combat. I am sure you realize that it is easier to bond with people when you interact with them more. There are limits to what one person can do alone. Great things cannot be achieved without allies.\nFelix: You sound like my father. You're saying it's in my own interest to make friends?\nSeteth: To put it simply, yes. As much as you possibly can. To be honest, I envy you. Because I know what it is like to not have many people to call friends.\nFelix: I wouldn't have guessed that. There are so many devout believers.\nSeteth: I am talking about friends. People to speak with on equal terms. You have many friends here. You should take care to attend to them.\nFelix: I'll consider your advice, but I'm not usually one to change my mind.\n(Felix leaves)\n\nSeteth: Ah, to be young._Seteth: Hello, Felix. Training alone again, I see.\nFelix: Spying on me again, I see.\nSeteth: It is not my intention to spy. I am merely concerned about you. I do not think you have been keeping your friends at a distance because you dislike them personally. Rather, I think what bothers you is their concept of proper knighthood. Is that not so?\nFelix: Hmph. You really have been watching me closely. You're correct. I don't understand why they revere knighthood. I won't be friends with anyone who believe in that nonsense.\nSeteth: Do you feel that way because of what happened in the Tragedy of Duscur? I have heard the story. Your brother was one of the royal knights. He gave his life to defend the prince.\nFelix: My brother was doing his job. My father is the real problem. When my brother's armor was brought back to the castle, do you know what he said? \"He died like a true knight.\" Chivalry begets the worship and glorification of death. Am I alone in finding that grotesque? I suppose you'll excommunicate me for blaspheming like this.\nSeteth: Not at all. I am not a knight, so I have no intentions of lecturing you about chivalry. So long as one's conduct is consistent with the teachings of the goddess, it is up to the individual to decide right from wrong.\nFelix: In that case, I'd like you to formally pardon me for not having friends.\nSeteth: You require no such pardon. This is merely advice from an old man to a younger one. As unwavering as your convictions may be, the others also feel strongly about their beliefs. If you hate all those whose beliefs are different from yours, you will hate everyone eventually. People with exactly the same beliefs as you simply do not exist.\nFelix: ...\nSeteth: You do not have to change your beliefs, of course. But you do have to accept that others feel differently. That is my advice to you. I will speak no more of it.\nFelix: Seteth. Can I ask one thing? Why are you going out of your way to tell me this? Why bother with me at all?\nSeteth: Because I trust you. Now that I have heard what you have to say, I trust you even more. I am also a rather eccentric person. I thought you and I might get along.\nFelix: I see. You've gone to so much trouble, I may have to start making an effort as well.\nSeteth: Good. Do not take this the wrong way, but I hope you will surpass my expectations._null_null_null_null_
16_18_(black screen)\n\nFelix: Hunh! Hya!\n(screen fades in; Flayn enters)\n\nFlayn: Spectacular work, Felix!\nFelix: Why are you here? You're interrupting.\nFlayn: Oh, uh— My apologies! I simply thought you were doing a great job... Just how sharp is that blade of yours, Felix? Do you imagine you might be able to cut something cleanly with it?\nFelix: Probably.\nFlayn: Ah, wonderful! I have a special request for you, then.\nFelix: You want me to cut this firewood?\nFlayn: I do. I shall toss them one by one to you, and you shall make a sweeping blow to slice them!\nFelix: Sounds like a chore.\nFlayn: I saw a knight do it once, so surely you can as well. Or perhaps you are worried that you are not capable.\nFelix: What? I am more than capable.\nFlayn: Right! Show me what you are made of. Here it co—\nFelix: Doing them one by one is tedious. Just throw them all at once.\nFlayn: All of them? If you insist! Here we go!\n(Felix slices the firewood)\n\nFlayn: Wow, you truly are spectacular!\nFelix: I know.\nFlayn: You are undoubtedly the most revered wood cutter in all the land. Now I am intrigued—next time, let us try an even larger wood pile!\nFelix: Why did I agree to this?_Felix: Flayn. What's that you're hiding?\nFlayn: Oh no! My surprise is spoiled! I had brought some fruits for you to cut up, in addition to the firewood. I thought some variation might prove amusing!\nFelix: No. I'm not doing that again. I've got better uses for my sword than chopping up fruit and firewood.\nFlayn: I cannot imagine what could be better than chopping fruit.\nFelix: Chopping up my enemies.\nFlayn: You say that as though you have many enemies. So you would rather chop people than firewood, is that it?\nFelix: That's not how I'd put it, but a blade's purpose is to kill. To chop wood, use an axe. To chop food, use a knife. It's simple.\nFlayn: Surely it is not forbidden to use your sword for other things. Like chopping fruit. Swords that cut inanimate objects are servings a much finer purpose than those that cut living beings.\nFelix: What a noble sentiment. But without a blade to cut down your enemies, you cannot win. Those who are weak lose everything, and they die. Those who are strong win, and live on. I understand why you balk at bloodshed, but you must know that it has a purpose.\nFlayn: And what purpose might that be?\nFelix: A purpose. Let's just leave it at that. I'm not in the mood to debate you. I'll continue to wield my sword. And, if necessary, cut down my enemies.\n(Felix leaves)\n\nFlayn: He certainly is a stubborn one..._Flayn: Felix!\nFelix: You. What is it now?\nFlayn: Do not fret. I have not come to ask you to chop wood. I have other things to speak of with you. You said that for one to live, they must also be prepared to kill.\nFelix: This again... Yes, that's what I said. You still have a problem with that?\nFlayn: No, I do not have a problem with it at all. I simply want you to live too.\nFelix: Oh. OK. Then I'll get back to my training.\nFlayn: Excuse me. I am not finished yet. During this time of war, you must wield your sword to ensure your own life. If that is the case, then it follows that we should bring an end to this war.\nFelix: To end the war, you'd have to kill more people.\nFlayn: Perhaps that is true. But once all is said and done, there would no longer be a need to kill, only to live. Is that not so?\nFelix: …\nFelix: That's pure fantasy. But if it came to pass, there would be no place for me. What would I do? I was raised to swing a sword. It's all I know. In a world without strife, warriors like me would be lost souls. It's tragic in a way. We fight to bring peace and then, if we achieve it, we lose our purpose.\nFlayn: I do not think that is anything you should worry yourself over. If the war ends and peace reigns, I shall be sure to have plenty of wood chopping for you to do!\nFelix: What a generous offer.\nFlayn: And! You will never be short on fruits and vegetables to chop for me either! If you felt like you lost your purpose in life, surely you would find a new purpose. It is not like you to be afraid of losing something, after all.\nFelix: Hm. I never thought about it, but maybe there is a path for me in peacetime. I'm intrigued. I might even like to realize this fantasy of yours.\nFlayn: Oh, that brings me such joy, Felix! Together, we can make this a reality. I can see it now— a life where you slice vegetables rather than people. I will greatly enjoy the day when we inhabit a world like that._null_null_null_
