17_41_Ferdinand: Hello, Professor. May I speak with you? You seem to hold Edelgard in high esteem. That is my impression, at least.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: She's a good student.\nChoice 2: She's got a lot to learn.\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: Hm. She is certainly talented. No doubt about that. But I wonder... What is your opinion of me? I am quite talented too, am I not?\nChoice 2 response: Well now! That is not what I expected you to say. You clearly have high standards. And what is your opinion of me? I am at least her equal, am I not?\nFerdinand: Be honest. Do not hold back. Pretend that I am just a regular person, not the scion of a noble house.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I think you two are evenly matched.\nChoice 2: I don't want to hurt your feelings, but...\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: Evenly matched?! Me? With her?!\nChoice 2 response: You think she is better than me?!\nFerdinand: I was just being modest before. Honestly, I have always prided myself on being superior to Edelgard. But evidently that is not your perspective. Hmm... I suppose there is only one thing to do. I must demonstrate my excellence!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's not necessary.\nChoice 2: I can't stop you.\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: Nonsense! You have entirely underestimated my abilities!\nChoice 2 response: Precisely! You cannot stop me! I will prove that you have drastically underestimated me.\nFerdinand: You think I could ignore such a slight on my honor? Not likely. Come, Professor!\nByleth: ...\nThe scene shifts to a forest backdrop.\n\nFerdinand: We will begin with battle. Edelgard's skills in combat are no match for mine. I heard that, just the other day, she defeated a Demonic Beast without assistance. Well, anything Edelgard can do, I can do better—and in half the time! Professor, you can be my eyewitness and timekeeper. Here we go! Two at once? That's... Well, it will be fine.\nScreen fades to black; Ferdinand tries to battle.\n\nFerdinand: Argh! I can't do it!\nByleth steps in to dispose of the Beasts.\n\nFerdinand: It seems you have saved my life. I... Thank you, Professor._Ferdinand: Hah! Haagh! Take that! Yaa! Aaargh!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're fighting more intensely than usual.\nChoice 2: What's up?\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: Yes. I am in a hurry.\nChoice 2 response: Oh, you know. There is always something. It never ends. Lately, I have been feeling uneasy. Impatient.\nFerdinand: Edelgard claims victory after victory. She never stops. Five years ago, she ascended the throne and swept away the corrupt nobles. My father included. I always thought I would be the one to unseat him. But she did it instead—with all the ease and indifference of someone cracking an egg.\nFerdinand:\n(Black Eagles route) Now, as the head of House Aegir, I serve Edelgard. I have to accept that I am her subordinate, working beneath her to unify Fódlan.\n(other routes) She put my father under house arrest. She stripped House Aegir of its power. Rather than accepting a role as her puppet, I left. Now I fight to topple the Empire.\nFerdinand: The disparity between Edelgard and myself is...obvious. She never stops moving forward. Single-minded. Never wavering. But where does that leave me? Here, flailing about, going nowhere, contributing nothing...\nByleth: That's not true.\nFerdinand: But it is! That is the reality. Not once since our days at the academy, have I exceeded Edelgard's abilities. I saw her as a worthy opponent. She did not even see me as a contender. She did not even consider me at all. As the head of the noble House Aegir, I must be able to achieve results. But all my efforts have come to nothing. Results are everything. I have not shown results, so I will be stagnating here forever.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: But you have achieved results!\nChoice 2: It's the journey, not the destination.\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: I appreciate your kind words, but you are wrong.\nChoice 2 response: I appreciate that, but it is not enough to persuade me.\nFerdinand: I know that I have a massive wall to climb, and I must climb it alone. Even so...may I ask a favor?\nByleth: Yes?\nFerdinand: Professor, please keep an eye on my progress. I would appreciate if you were always by my side, bearing witness to my accomplishments._Ferdinand: Hmmm. What an interesting way of looking at life. Ah, it is you! Just at the right time.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're working late.\nChoice 2: The right time?\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: Oh, is it nighttime already? I must have gotten carried away.\nFerdinand: There is something I wanted to discuss. Something about you... I am starting to believe that you are a true hero. You hold the lost Crest, you wield the Sword of the Creator, and you lead everyone in battle against great enemies. Not only that, but you are a strategist. You give everyone direction, so they know what needs to be done. You do not seem particularly ambitious. And yet, you accomplish so much.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's high praise.\nChoice 2: That's true. I'm not ambitious.\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: I am not exaggerating. Everything I said is true.\nChoice 2 response: I am amazed that you can say so.\nFerdinand: I have been reading about the history of Faerghus, you know. The Kingdom's founder, Loog, the \"King of Lions,\" had two advisors. One of them was Pan, the \"undesiring strategist.\" According to historical records, Pan wanted nothing for himself. He devoted himself entirely to Loog. He had tremendous power, but he never seemed concerned about his legacy. So, in the old chronicles, there is hardly any mention of Pan's deeds. All that we know is that he helped Loog, his friend and leader.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: To think, someone could be so virtuous.\nChoice 2: I've never heard of Pan.\nFerdinand: It is not surprising that you have never heard of him. I did not even know his name until recently. But when I watch how you conduct yourself, I feel that I am seeing the unknown deeds of Pan. It is only a thought, of course, but it makes me feel rather happy. Even if it is not in the pages of a history book, a life can be full of achievement! I know that I will never prevail over Edelgard. Even if I defeat her on the battlefield... I am what I am. Like you and this \"undesiring strategist.\" I will do what I'm called to do, even if no mark of me remains in the history books._null_null_null_

Would you agree?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No, not really.\nChoice 2: It certainly has.\nFerdinand:\nChoice 1 response: Haha! You cannot humor me even a little? Perhaps we can agree that every long road comes to an end.\nChoice 2 response: Every long road comes to an end.\nFerdinand: That is when friends who have walked together must go their separate ways. You will guide Fódlan. I will return to my position as Duke Aegir. Life will go on. It must.\nByleth: So it seems.\nFerdinand: I once asked something of you. I asked you to bear witness to my achievements. But even if I achieve nothing and there is nothing left of me after I am gone... I still want you to see me.\nByleth: What do you mean?\nFerdinand: I mean that I want you to be my wife! I need you as much as I need my next breath. More, perhaps. I hope that you need me too.\nByleth: I understand.\nFerdinand: That is it? You hear noble Ferdinand von Aegir declare his love for you, and all you say is \"I understand\"? This is torture! Please, if you are going to refuse my proposal, simply tell me.\nByleth: Need isn't a strong enough word.\nFerdinand: I am not sure I understand...\nByleth: I love you, Ferdinand.\nFerdinand: Really?! Ah, my head is ringing with pure joy! Like a thousand bells! It is even greater than the joy of victory in battle. It is victory in life itself!\nByleth: ...\nFerdinand: Ahem. Apologies. I got a little carried away there. I am shaking... I cannot control it. It would be no exaggeration to say that my whole life, everything I have done, has led me to this moment. I am overjoyed! Oh dear, I might faint...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm happy too.\nChoice 2: You look pretty unsteady.\nFerdinand: Give me a minute or two to regain my balance before you say anything too fantastic... Imagine, making our way through life, side by side. The whole world has taken on a rosy hue. Ah, it is no use. I cannot stay upright. Please, let me lean on your shoulder.\nFerdinand: That is better. We are as close as can be. From now on, we will lean on each other. Thank you, my love.
17_23_Ferdinand: Hm. With this idea, I may be able to get the one-up on Edelgard.\nHubert: This again.\nFerdinand: Hubert! I wish you would not sneak up on me like that.\nHubert: Maybe you would be more perceptive if your mind were less burdened by sedition.\nFerdinand: Sedition? Absurd. This is an important project.\nHubert: Yes, I heard. A new way to prove how superior you are to Lady Edelgard. She is not your rival, Ferdinand. She is above you. A noble, like you, ought to know his place.\nFerdinand: Anything is better than being a noble like you. Every time you open your mouth it's \"Lady Edelgard this\" or \"Lady Edelgard that.\" Do you ever think for yourself? You follow her around like a pet. You spend all of your time fretting over her, and yet you never truly express an opinion of your own. Before you reprimand me, take a moment to consider your own failings.\nHubert: Your nonsense is tiresome, so I hope this will be the last time I have to remind you. Lady Edelgard is the Imperial princess. You are merely the prime minister's son.\nFerdinand: Yes, I understand that. But my duty is to guide her, to give frank advice when she is on the wrong course of action. That is what I strive to do, always. Thus my devotion to surpass Edelgard, so that if she needs guidance, I will be prepared for it. If you think it is tiresome to have a mind of your own, you will never be much of an advisor.\nHubert: Does the river of filth pouring out of your mouth ever stop flowing? Your obsession with all things superficial is disgusting. It's no use. You're hopeless. I'll take my leave.\nFerdinand: I have nothing more to say to you. Get out of here._Hubert: Show them this letter. Threaten them. Do what you must. Now, go.\nImperial Soldier: Yes, sir!\nFerdinand: Hubert, that letter. Is that what I think it was?\nHubert: I suppose there's no denying it.\nFerdinand: But Edelgard—\nHubert: Explicitly forbade me to send it. Yes, I know.\nFerdinand: I cannot believe it! You disobeyed a direct order? I thought you were her loyal aide.\nHubert: Unwaveringly. All that I do, I do for her. I seem to recall you expressing a similar sentiment. It is our role to guide her when she is on the wrong course of action. Is that not what you said?\nFerdinand: You are not supposed to do it in secret! When you disagree with your leader, you must voice your concerns directly. Otherwise, what is the point?\nHubert: The point is the same. Lady Edelgard's best interests are served, whether she knows it or not. She needs not trouble herself with the mundane details of my actions. Only results matter.\nFerdinand: You are sorely misguided! When I believe Edelgard is making a mistake, I tell her as much. Through discussing the matter, I sometimes find that I was mistaken. To skip that process, to make a decision that is not yours to make...\nHubert: Perhaps your advice is simply useless, then.\nFerdinand: Excuse me?!\nHubert: Listen to yourself. If I do as Lady Edelgard requires, then you tell me to be more independent. But if I tread my own path, I am misguided! I suppose the fault is mine for expecting any useful advice to come out of your mouth. Heh.\nFerdinand: Ugh, I have had enough of your grousing. To think, I started to believe you were a useful aide._Hubert: It's strange. I never thought you and I would be able to sit together and drink tea like this.\nFerdinand: Drink tea, you say, but that does not smell like tea. The aroma... Would that be coffee by any chance? Imported from Dagda, I believe. I do not care for it myself.\nHubert: Your knowledge is impressive. Although I should expect nothing less from a noble, I suppose. Lady Edelgard surpasses you in nearly every respect. But I think, when it comes to positivity, you may actually exceed her.\nFerdinand: Excuse me?\nHubert: In a way, it is merely a mask for your tactlessness. But even so, your relentless optimism... Well. Suffice it to say that it is your best quality.\nFerdinand: I... What?\nHubert: You are constantly striving to grow as a person. To seek new knowledge. To push new limits. When others get distracted or abandon their path, you never yield. In that aspect, at least, I think you are unmatched.\nFerdinand: Hubert... Are you all right? Do you have a cold? Or the plague? Am I hearing a deathbed confession?\nHubert: It was only a compliment. There's no need for such dramatic exaggeration.\nFerdinand: Dramatic, you say?\nHubert: I do my best to analyze others without emotion. Even if I find you to be a contemptible degenerate, I can still evaluate your abilities in an impartial way.\nFerdinand: So because you assess people without emotion, you're totally confident in your appraisals. It seems I was wrong about you.\nHubert: Heh. You actually understand.\nFerdinand: Please do not compliment me again though. I find it quite unsettling. It is like hearing a snake sing an aria. At least put it in a letter next time.\nHubert: In the very unlikely event that there is a next time, I promise to put it in writing._Hubert: Hello, Ferdinand. Wait—that aroma...\nFerdinand: Your nose is as sharp as ever, Hubert. Yes, it is a bag of fresh coffee beans.\nHubert: Why did you buy coffee? You said you don't care for it.\nFerdinand: My stance has not changed. Drab, bitter, with a muddy texture. If I have even a sip, my hands start to tremble.\nHubert: Rather harsh. What are you doing with it, then?\nFerdinand: Well, you see— Wait a moment. What is that? Is that an imported tea from the east?\nHubert: It is indeed. Keen eyes.\nFerdinand: Flaunting my favorite drink, right in front of me! And you do not even drink tea. Fiendish. It is for Edelgard, I assume?\nHubert: Before I answer that, I would like to know what you are doing with the coffee.\nFerdinand: Well, I...\nHubert: Is it a gift? Perhaps for someone you fancy?\nFerdinand: A gift, yes. For you.\nHubert: Hm. Who is the unlucky— Did you say for me?! This coffee is a gift for me? Have I heard you correctly?\nFerdinand: Yes, that is what I said. A noble does not go back on his word. Just take it.\nHubert: I should decline.\nFerdinand: Why?\nHubert: The thought of receiving a gift from you, unbidden and unreciprocated, fills me with revulsion. Therefore...accept this tea. As a gift. From me.\nFerdinand: For me? Are you certain? I would hate to deprive the intended recipient of such a fine tea.\nHubert: That would be difficult to do, since I bought it with you in mind.\nFerdinand: Oh, in that case, thank— What? You were planning to give this to me all along?\nHubert: That is what I said.\nFerdinand: Really? I... Hahaha!\nHubert: Hahaha.\nFerdinand: Only one thing to do. We must take a tea break.\nHubert: Very well. But tea is not what I will be drinking.\nFerdinand: Of course. I will make you some coffee.\nHubert: Then I will prepare the tea._A+_null_
17_28_Linhardt: Just look at this place... It's so beautiful. I believe I should take a nap and enjoy it properly.\nFerdinand: Linhardt. Lost in thought, I see. Unacceptable! Are you not aware that a noble's duty is to be ever vigilant?\nLinhardt: Rest increases alertness. Is there something I can do for you, Ferdinand?\nFerdinand: Well, I was just passing by, and I thought I could give you a little advice. You always seem to be napping. Why not spend your free time doing something productive?\nLinhardt: Easier said than done, Ferdinand. I'm afraid I suffer from a constitution that tires easily.\nFerdinand: Hmph. Some training will remedy that. Let us work on that today. I will train you myself! Arise, Linhardt! The righteous path of the noble lies before you!\nLinhardt: You're always giving it your all, aren't you?\nFerdinand: Yes, I am. is there something wrong with that?\nLinhardt: Of course not. In fact, I rather enjoy your demeanor. You go all out even when other wish you wouldn't. You work hard, inspire the admiration of others, and your dignity as a noble is beyond reproach.\nFerdinand: I consider it my mission to serve as a guide and a model for other members of the nobility.\nLinhardt: As capable as you are striking. Next to you, I am a mere infant.\nFerdinand: Oh, you are far too kind... Although I do work hard each day to achieve all of which you speak.\nLinhardt: You've mastered all the important noble skills. You drink tea, talk about how great you are, ride horses...\nFerdinand: Indeed! I went for a ride earlier today.\nLinhardt: Is that so? You'll have to tell me about it sometime when I'm not walking away...\nLinhardt walks away.\n\nFerdinand: Hm? Where are you going?\nLinhardt: I must get some sleep, being the infant that I am. Farewell for now, Ferdinand, oh noble among nobles.\nFerdinand: \"Noble among nobles\"? Seems a bit much. Did he say \"get some sleep\"? Hey, wait!\nFerdinand runs after Linhardt._Ferdinand: Linhardt. There you are.\nLinhardt: Observant as ever, Ferdinand. What can I help you with?\nFerdinand: You have been utilizing clever tricks to give me the slip. But not today. Prepare yourself! \"A noble cannot escape from his duty.\" Hold these words in your heart.\nLinhardt: It seems you really mean it this time. I suppose I have no choice but to outmatch you.\nFerdinand: Finally, a little enthusiasm. You are bravely stepping upon the path of nobility. Let us begin!\nLinhardt: Come now, Ferdinand, Don't be foolish. I can't possibly train with you... I have places to be.\nLinhardt runs away.\n\nFerdinand: Wait! I will not allow you to get away!\nFerdinand runs after Linhardt\n\nLinhardt: I... I can't... I can't run anymore.\nFerdinand: Just admit defeat...\nLinhardt: Can't we... just a minute... Ferdinand ... let me... let me catch my breath.\nFerdinand: Well, maybe just for a moment... I could use a rest myself. I am surprised you could run that far. I had assumed that all that lounging around would have dulled your constitution. But I had a difficult time keeping up.\nLinhardt: The fear... of having to exert myself really helped. You're none too slow yourself. It's been a while since I ran like that. It actually feels pretty good.\nFerdinand: It does, does it not? Well, how about we say that thrilling chase was your training for the day? If you will excuse me, I am going to run even more, so I can catch you next time!\nLinhardt: After all the running you already did? That's our Ferdinand. You always give everything your all, don't you?\nFerdinand: Haha, and what is wrong with that?\nLinhardt: Nothing whatsoever, Ferdinand. I mean that._null_null_null_null_
17_34_Ferdinand is reading a book\n\nPetra: Ferdinand? Our professor is wanting to see you...\nFerdinand: Hmm.\nPetra: He has much concentration right now. I will wait for him to be finished reading.\nFerdinand: Mm hmm...\nPetra: ...\nFerdinand: Diplomacy has an effect upon weapons development. Yes... That makes sense. Oh! Petra! How long have you been there?\nPetra: A short time. You were devoting all of your attention to that book.\nFerdinand: Forgive me. I was fully absorbed in my reading. I see you have been reading as well. Anything interesting?\nPetra: I am studying the history of Fódlan.\nFerdinand: A history book! What a keen student you are. And it's about House Hresvelg. Certainly a stimulating topic.\nPetra: I am wishing to learn all about Fódlan. What is the book you are reading?\nFerdinand: Oh, this? This relates to a little hobby of mine— the regional history of weapons development in Fódlan. Militaries have to adapt their weapons according to terrain and climate, and they have to keep up with technologies in other regions. It's very interesting.\nPetra: Yes, it is interesting. I see why you would be enjoying that kind of reading.\nFerdinand: Oh, does that excite your curiosity too? Perhaps you would care to read more about it, then. This is just one of 18 volumes. And our library has the entire collection!\nPetra: I give you my gratitude. Research of weapons could be a good reference for me. Oh, please take my apologies. I was meaning to tell you that our professor is wanting to see you.\nFerdinand: Oh! It is not like you to forget something. I suppose I ought to be going, then.\nFerdinand leaves\n\nPetra: Yes, it is a rarity that I forget something. But it is not impossible._Ferdinand: Taking care of some weapon maintenance, Petra? You seem completely absorbed.\nPetra: Yes, taking care of the weapons has great importance.\nFerdinand: I cannot argue with that. That weapon there... is it from Brigid?\nPetra: No, it is a weapon of Dagda. But the people of Brigid use... I mean, used them often.\nFerdinand: Fascinating! I have read about the weapons of Dagda, but this is my first time seeing one in person.\nPetra: Lots of weapons and fighting techniques came from Dagda to Brigid.\nFerdinand: Ah, so Dagda to the west had a big influence on the Brigid archipelago. I am fascinated by foreign fighting techniques. Would you consider teaching me sometime?\nPetra: I will. But it is difficult to explain fighting with words. We can try sparring, maybe?\nFerdinand: Yes, a practical demonstration! I would be quite grateful.\nPetra: Let's have our beginning, then!\nFade to black, slashes appear on screen before fading back in\n\nFerdinand: Perhaps we should stop there...\nPetra: Oh? Do you think you have understanding of the fighting techniques from Dagda?\nFerdinand: Yes, now I have experienced it firsthand. I used to look down on foreign fighting styles, but I was clearly remiss. The footwork, the nimble way you shift your weight, is extraordinary. I will have to remember those moves for the next time I am in battle. Clearly, you have honed your skills through practice. Your fist felt as sharp as a spear.\nPetra: Brigid is stuck between Dagda and Fódlan. It is of much importance to hone our fighting techniques. I am of the royal family, but I am a warrior before that. I must fight to live and to protect my home.\nFerdinand: When the alliance of Brigid and Dagda encroached on the Empire they were always driven back. But perhaps the Empire's victory was due to geographic advantage or divine intervention rather than military superiority. Having met you, that is what I think. I cannot help but feel a little disgraced. I help foreign fighting styles in such low regard without ever seeing them for myself.\nPetra: When I came to Fódlan... I felt disgraced from many things that I learned. But there is no disgrace in losing ignorance. We need to be learning and growing with each other, always.\nFerdinand: Yes, by working together we can make progress. And both sides need to look ahead, to the future._Petra: Ferdinand...\nFerdinand: Huh? Ah, Petra. Is there something I can help you with?\nPetra: No, I am not needing help. I was just thinking that you look... lonely.\nFerdinand: Lonely, in wartime? Hardly. I am too busy trying to survive to feel lonely. But once we have survived, what will you do with yourself, Petra? Return to your home?\n(Crimson Flower route) Edelgard said she would like you to ascend the throne in Brigid, to ensure good relations between the nations.\n(Other routes)\nPetra: Yes... My plan is to be returning home. But if Brigid and Fódlan can be friendly, I will be able to have visits whenever I choose. Maybe it is even possible for me to be living in Fódlan.\nFerdinand: Live in Fódlan? Do you not want to go back to your homeland?\nPetra: I do have the hope of returning one day, but Fódlan is also like a homeland to me now. I came to Fódlan nine years ago. I have been living half of my life here. My family is living in Brigid, but in Fódlan, I have new family and new friends.\nFerdinand: New family? I am glad to hear you feel that way about us, Petra. In that case, we will have to make sure that none of us die. We do not want to lose anyone in the family.\nPetra: Yes! We will be winning, and you will not be dying!\nFerdinand: Hah, do not worry. I do not intend to die. I have some things to do when the war is over.\nPetra: Things?\nFerdinand: Yes. You and I can be the link between Fódlan and Brigid.\nPetra: Oh!\nFerdinand: OK, I have to confess, I fibbed a little... About not being lonely. When this war ends, I will be quite lonely indeed... if you go back to Brigid.\nPetra: Is that a truth?\nFerdinand: I have just made a decision. I will work as an ambassador, improving relations between our people. Whether you are in Brigid or Fódlan, I will be there too. Then both places can move forward together, in eternal friendship... We ought to join forces and make that a reality. Do you not agree?\nPetra: You have my gratitude, Ferdinand. All of it! I have loneliness just like you...but your words gave me great happiness. Please do what you are saying... and be a bridge for Fódlan and Brigid.\nFerdinand: You can count on me. We will keep at it, and one day...\nPetra: Yes! One day we will be seeing that future!_null_null_null_
17_33_Mercedes: ...\nFerdinand: Oh, Mercedes. This is unexpected.\nMercedes: Hello, Ferdinand. Did you come to pray?\nFerdinand: I did. I quite like the atmosphere in the cathedral. It is holy and solemn. Perfectly suited to a noble, wouldn't you say?\nMercedes: Uhh... I guess so.\nFerdinand: You guess so? I think the matter is rather clear-cut. It is incumbent upon nobles that we pray regularly to the goddess.\n(Crimson Flower, post-time skip) Even Edelgard, who opposes the church's methods, does not deny us the right to pray to the goddess.\nFerdinand: The piety of the nobles is a model for commoners— it teaches them the value of devotion.\nMercedes: Absolutely. I know exactly what you mean. I couldn't agree more.\nFerdinand: These days many nobles scarcely, if ever, pray. Look around! You and I are alone in this cathedral. It is really quite a shame.\nMercedes: Ah, well, I don't really know that I count as a noble anyway.\nFerdinand: I am afraid the nobility seems to be losing its way. When you pray, you are usually alone, right?\nMercedes: Umm...yes. You're right. I usually am.\nFerdinand: Precisely. Where are the others? Of course, you cannot force people to worship. That is out of the question. Nobles must determine for themselves what they will believe and how they will pray. A religion foisted on you without your say is not much of a religion at all. Do you not agree?\nMercedes: Yes, I definitely agree. Definitely...agree.\nFerdinand: On the other hand, we cannot stand idly by while...\nMercedes: Um, it was great talking to you, but I'm getting pretty sleepy. I'm going to head off to bed. Good night!\nMercedes walks away\n\nFerdinand: All in all, one has to conclude... Mercedes? Where did she go? I must have inspired her to go out and revive the faith! Perhaps I should do the same. I cannot let her show me up..._Church Soldier A: Come on! Sell it to me!\nMercedes walks up to two soldiers\n\nMercedes: Huh? What's going on here? Hey! Stop that! Can't you see he's not interested?\nChurch Soldier A: We're just talking business here. Now move it along.\nMercedes: Oh! I just thought it looked a little... Actually, now I'm curious. What kind of business are you conducting? I've been told I have a keen eye for appraisal.\nChurch Soldier A: Just trying to buy a sword... I told him to name his price, but he won't give it up!\nMercedes: Any price? You must be able to afford anything your heart desires! But did you consider that he might have a good reason to not sell it? Maybe it's a family heirloom. Or simply his favorite sword.\nChurch Soldier A: No one asked for your appraisal! Now move it! Or are you looking for trouble?\nFerdinand: That is quite enough! You would dare threaten a woman? I will not permit such ungentlemanly conduct.\nMercedes: Oh. Hello, Ferdinand. Do you have an opinion on all this?\nFerdinand: Behind me, milady! I will protect you!\nScene briefly fades to black\n\nChurch Soldier A: Who are you? You looking for trouble too?\nFerdinand: Keep your distance, gutless knave! I just cleaned my sword, and if I maim you I will have to clean it again. Neither of us wants that, so I suggest you leave at once.\nChurch Soldier A: Gah! Forget it! You're not worth my time!\nChurch Soldier A runs away\n\nChurch Soldier B: Ah, thank you so much... You saved me there.\nChurch Soldier B walks away\n\nFerdinand: Well, that was taken care of. Are you hurt, Mercedes?\nMercedes: Hurt? No, I'm fine. We were only talking.\nFerdinand: Ah, I'm glad! I do not abide uncouth behavior. Stopping it is my duty as a noble!_Ferdinand: Mercedes, finally! There you are.\nMercedes: Ah! Ferdinand! Why are you so short of breath?\nFerdinand: I just wanted to show you something.\nFerdinand shows Mercedes some papers\n\nMercedes: What's this... Um... Oh!\nFerdinand: Yes. These are financial records that I recovered from your adoptive father. They prove that when he adopted you, large sums of money changed hands.\nMercedes: Where did you come across these?\nFerdinand: I stealthily made my way into Fhirdiad and looked around his estate. It was easy. That kind of thing is no trouble for an intrepid young noble such as myself.\nMercedes: That's amazing! I mean... amazingly irresponsible! I can't believe you put yourself at risk for my benefit. I really wish you wouldn't do such things!\nFerdinand: No, I did it for my benefit. I could not help myself. With these documents, we can show everyone what a scoundrel your adoptive father really is. His noble aspirations will be crushed. The lord of the region will probably rescind his adoption contract. In other words, you will be free. Here, take them. Do with them what you will.\nMercedes: Do you really believe these will set me free?\nFerdinand: Yes. Of course. You will be free to decide your own path in life and go wherever your heart leads you.\nMercedes: That does sound nice...but... I'm sorry, Ferdinand, but I think you should hold on to the documents.\nFerdinand: Why? Is that not what you want?\nMercedes: I've lived so much of my life following everyone else's lead... So much so that I've come to terms with it. It's almost unavoidable at this point. But with these...I could regain my freedom and change all that.\nFerdinand: You baffle me. Do you not wish to be free?\nMercedes: Of course I do. Let me try that again in a way you might understand. Ahem. A true noble cuts their own path, seizing freedom from the clutches of tyranny!\nFerdinand: I cannot argue with that. Fine, then. I will hold on to the documents.\nMercedes: But I am really very happy that you're so concerned with my well-being, Ferdinand. It means so much to me that you went through all that trouble on my behalf.\nFerdinand: Of course, Mercedes. The smile on your face is well worth the effort._Ferdinand: You know, stepping in to prevent extortion, that was quite brave of you.\nMercedes: What? Oh, you're talking about that time in town. I wouldn't say I did anything brave, really. I just asked what was going on.\nFerdinand: No need to be humble. Helping the weak is precisely what a virtuous noble does.\nMercedes: I...I don't think what I did was quite the same thing.\nFerdinand: What do you mean by that?\nMercedes: The point I was trying to make is that some things in this world can't be bought or sold with money. I think I let myself get a little too worked up though. It's just... when I saw it happening, it reminded me of my own past...\nFerdinand: Your past. Hm. You were originally the daughter of House Bartels, a minor noble family, I heard. You abandoned your title, and now you live as a commoner. Is there more to the story? Pray tell.\nMercedes: Life was becoming... difficult for us, so my mother and I fled from House Bartels. We found refuge in a small church in Faerghus and lived there for a few years. A man appeared one day and said that he wanted to adopt me. It was obvious he only cared about my bloodline and Crest. The priest refused to let me go, but the man used his money to overwhelm the church. In the end, I had no choice but to leave with him. That solider we saw... I guess he just reminded me of my adopted father.\nFerdinand: The man who exploited you so he could join the nobility. Yes, I understand. But I must confess, that part of the story confuses me. There is nothing to gain from having a noble title.\nMercedes: Hehe.\nFerdinand: What's so funny?\nMercedes: I never thought I'd hear you question the value of nobility, Ferdinand.\nFerdinand: Oh, well... That's not quite what I meant. Using someone else to obtain high status, with no effort and no accomplishment...Certainly, you can obtain a title like that, but it hardly makes you a noble.\nMercedes: I completely agree.\nFerdinand: By the same token, although you are legally a commoner, in your heart you are a proud and virtuous noble! That is what I think, at any rate._B+_null_
17_29_Lorenz: Ah—that fragrance! Could it be? Ferdinand. I cannot help but notice the exquisite tea you're drinking.\nFerdinand: Not many can appreciate it, let alone recognize it. I am impressed.\nLorenz: Perhaps you would be so good as to indulge me with a cup?\nFerdinand: By all means! Allow me to pour.\nLorenz: Ah, what a delightful aroma. When I close my eyes, I feel as though I've wandered into a rose garden.\nFerdinand: Such a precise, poetic description. But please, drink up. No need to stand on ceremony.\nLorenz: How gracious of you. Very well. Flavor, fragrance, and hue, all in fine harmony. This is a most superior brew. And in a market saturated by pale imitation, no less. You did well to acquire such fine fare.\nFerdinand: You are clearly quite passionate about tea. And more than just passionate... You know what it takes to brew a fine cup. To say nothing of your flawless etiquette and sterling attentiveness!\nLorenz: Certainly. Proper etiquette at tea time is one of the surest hallmarks of quality breeding. And the extent of one's attentiveness is quite often indicative of the depth of one's character. The ability of a person of fine stock to exhibit a rich quality of character is precisely what determines whether one is worthy to be called noble. All of that can be seen in how one handles such a simple thing as a cup of tea.\nFerdinand: Ah, marvelously put, Lorenz. I can tell you have given much thought to this subject. And if I may, I have always considered you to be the very model of noble comportment.\nLorenz: Likewise. This has certainly been an extraordinarily meaningful cup of tea.\nFerdinand: I wholeheartedly concur. Before we part ways, I would like to offer you some of these leaves.\nLorenz: Truly? I'm flattered, but I cannot simply accept them without offering something in exchange. You simply must allow me to host you in turn. By way of recompense. We shall drink from House Gloucester's finest teacups and enjoy the loveliest of its cakes.\nFerdinand: That sounds exquisite. I look forward to it._Lorenz: That reminds me, Ferdinand. I wonder if a certain rumor has already reached your ears.\nFerdinand: I suspect I know what you are referring to. A certain noble who caused a stir at one of the local taverns, correct? For someone of status to make such a scene! What a disgrace.\nLorenz: I thought just the same. A noble ought to hold himself to a higher standard. It is hardly appropriate to drink and mingle with a tavern full of commoners.\nFerdinand: Oh, ah, that is not quite what I meant. I do not object to a noble patronizing their local establishments. In fact, I would say such excursions have value.\nLorenz: Is that so? I would be very curious to hear what value you mean exactly. But allow me first to venture a guess. Is it that you suppose it is proper for a noble to bolster a town's wealth with his patronage? If that is your thinking, then I would counter that whatever one adds to a merchant's coffers seldom makes it to the pockets of the townsfolk. I think that if a noble wishes to use his resources to ease the burdens of the commoners, he ought to go about ton and spend it more directly.\nFerdinand: That is wonderfully insightful, Lorenz, albeit not what I had in mind. What I meant was this—we can benefit from crossing the threshold and learning more about regular folk. We scarcely understand the reality of their lives. In turn, they do not know about us. I have heard that some believe we have horns growing from our heads. It is an embarrassing, and potentially perilous, state of affairs.\nLorenz: You are quite right. In fact, that reminds me of something a boy once said to me when I visited a village in my father's territory. He actually asked me if I had a tail. Ah, hilarious!\nFerdinand: We all need a laugh now and then. As a man of status, I feel it is my calling to right the world's wrongs. But there is only so much I can do alone. Working in tandem, though, you and I could make tremendous accomplishments.\nLorenz: My sentiments exactly. Together we could achieve a great deal. Though the circumstances of birth may have placed one of us in the Empire and the other in the Alliance, we can still study and fight together.\nFerdinand: Yes, precisely! Together, there is nothing that we cannot accomplish. By the way Lorenz... Do you have a tail?_null_null_null_null_
17_32_Ferdinand: Ah, Marianne. Praying to the goddess?\nMarianne: Yes, I am.\nFerdinand: Excellent! So persistent in your devotion. I quite admire that about you.\nMarianne: Oh, no. It's not like that.\nFerdinand: No need for false modesty. I hardly know anyone with more piety.\nMarianne: I need to be going.\nMarianne turns to leave\n\nFerdinand: Wait a moment!\nMarianne: Oh! Um, yes? Did you need something?\nFerdinand: I have a suggestion. I have been meaning to tell you about it for a while. Have you ever considered projecting more confidence? Your every word is laden with pessimism and devoid of enthusiasm. To gain the trust of commoners, you must appear self-assured at all times.\nMarianne: I have no need to earn the trust of the common people as a noble. All I want is to live a quiet life and to not be a bother to anyone. I dare not hope for anything beyond that.\nFerdinand: But you are the only daughter of the esteemed Margrave Edmund! Regardless of what you hope for, you must concede that you have inherited certain responsibilities, by virtue of your birth.\nMarianne: If that's the case, then I don't care to be a responsible person. Farewell!\nMarianne leaves\n\nFerdinand: One would think she does not wish to be a noble..._Marianne: ...\nFerdinand: Marianne. Are you not going to pray?\nMarianne: I've finished. What is it?\nFerdinand: I just wanted to apologize.\nMarianne: It's fine, Ferdinand. You did nothing wrong.\nFerdinand: Last time we spoke, I did not quite finish saying what I wanted to say. You say I did nothing wrong, so perhaps you will hear me out this time?\nMarianne: Very well. What is it?\nFerdinand: Rather than mourning the way things are, is it not better to accept reality and move forward from there?\nMarianne: Accept and move forward?\nFerdinand: Precisely. You curse your heritage and reject your present situation. That makes you gloomy, even despairing. As long as you are held back by that way of thinking, nothing is ever going to change.\nMarianne: What about you? Do you really believe that you accept whatever comes in life?\nFerdinand: I do. Come what may, I will never falter.\n(Black Eagles): Look at me. I lost my lands, my wealth, my status. I accept this reality, dark as it is.\nMarianne: How?\nFerdinand: Well, each person is born with a purpose. We must fulfill that purpose, no matter our circumstances. It imbues our lives with meaning and direction. That is what I believe, anyway. Everyone has something they are meant to accomplish. That is true for nobles, commoners, even bandits.\nMarianne: I-I see... so that's what you believe. Do you... really think it's possible that someone like me has a purpose to fulfill?\nFerdinand: Yes! Of course.\nMarianne: Oh! I'll give this some serious thought. Thank you, Ferdinand. Your words have deeply moved me.\nFerdinand: Is that so? How wonderful! I will pray that you find the answers you seek._Marianne: Mmm... delicious...\nFerdinand: Marianne, may I join you?\nMarianne: Yes, Ferdinand. Of course.\nFerdinand sits\n\nFerdinand: Hmm...\nMarianne: Um, is something wrong?\nFerdinand: I am sorry, but, uh... You seem very different. Compared to how you were before.\nMarianne: That may be true.\nFerdinand: Right there! You are smiling. I do not think I have ever seen you smile.\nMarianne: Please... you're making me blush...\nFerdinand: I do not mean to embarrass you! I am just saying, you seem to have truly changed.\nMarianne: Well, I have you to thank for that. In truth, I spent a lot of time thinking about what you said. It meant so much when you told me that everyone has a purpose to fulfill. Even me.\nFerdinand: I am so glad to hear you say that, Marianne. I wonder, did you find a purpose for yourself?\nMarianne: No, not yet... But I've been much happier since I started thinking about it more. I remembered a time back when I was working at the animal clinic. The rest of the staff was so thankful for the work I had done. Even in something as simple as looking after animals, I was able to make myself useful to others. Thinking about it made me realize that anyone can make other people happy. Even someone like me.\nFerdinand: It sounds to me like you have already found your answer.\nMarianne: What do you mean?\nFerdinand: Making people happy. If you ask me, that is a truly worthwhile purpose.\nMarianne: You may be right! Ah! I just remembered! I wanted to ask about your food.\nFerdinand: Yes, what about it?\nMarianne: Today was my turn to prepare the meal. How is it?\nFerdinand: Oh! It is delicious! The flavor and the texture are superb. So you are certainly making me happy!\nMarianne: I'm glad you like it.\nFerdinand: I hope you will learn to like yourself. For what it is worth, I like you.\nMarianne: Oh?\nFerdinand: Maybe, if you have the time, you can cook something for me again? For me alone, I mean.\nMarianne: Of course! It would be my pleasure!_Marianne: Are you enjoying this lovely day, Dorte? Everyone seems to be in such good spirits.\nDorte neighs\n\nFerdinand: Marianne, do you have a moment?\nMarianne: Oh! Ferdinand! What do you need?\nFerdinand: I have been thinking about what you said.\nMarianne: I didn't mean to upset you. You should just ignore me and—\nFerdinand: You misunderstand. It is not that you upset me. Honestly, you mystify me. You are a noble, and yet you do not wish to be one. Is that not so? I did not expect to hear that from the daughter of Margrave Edmund.\nMarianne: But... I'm not actually his daughter. He's a distant relative. We share very little of the same blood.\nFerdinand: But still, you come from a noble lineage, do you not?\nMarianne: Oh, no. I'm just a minor noble from the countryside.\nFerdinand: Minor though it may be, you were born into a noble family. Which means you are a noble too. We did not choose to become nobles. We were born into the nobility.\nMarianne: I understand, but that's why... Why I said I don't care to be responsible. I had no say in the matter!\nFerdinand: Marianne! I—\nMarianne: My parents and I have suffered because of this bloodline and Crest. Even so, I am prepared to do what I must as the daughter of a noble family... But to be told that's still not enough, I... I just... Ugh!\nFerdinand: I... I see. I will not pretend to understand. But you should try to calm down a bit. Certainly, things did not turn out the way you had hoped. But the conditions are such that—\nMarianne: The conditions? Those will never change. There's nothing to do but give up! Please, just leave! Ignore me!\nFerdinand: There will be no convincing you. Very well. I will go.\nFerdinand leaves\n\nMarianne: Oh Goddess... Why did you curse me with such suffering?_C+_null_
17_22_Hilda: It just never ends... Oh! Ferdinand!\nFerdinand: Hilda! Do you need something?\nHilda: I just have a tiny favor to ask.\nFerdinand: I apologize, but I must graciously decline.\nHilda: You didn't even let me say what it was!\nFerdinand: I can proffer a guess. Instead of relying on others, why not try doing something on your own? Nobles should not be lazy or idle. We should accomplish our goals through earnest effort.\nHilda: Easy for you to say! You're the very model of a diligent noble. Always contemplating the noblest course of action, never stopping to take a break... Your chore today was repairing the weapons, right? There are so many weapons here, and yet you're already done. That's pretty impressive.\nFerdinand: It was nothing! Anyone could have done the same.\nHilda: I don't think so! I certainly couldn't.\nFerdinand: I do not believe that to be true.\nHilda: Look at me. I'm supposed to be organizing these library supplies, but I have no idea where to start.\nFerdinand: What could be difficult about such a task? You simply line them up and count them.\nHilda: There are too many! Maybe it doesn't seem difficult to you, but that's just because you're so clever.\nFerdinand: Granted, there might be some creative approaches to completing the task...\nHilda: Oh? Please, enlighten me!\nFerdinand: Hm. I can point you in the right direction. To start, divide them up by size.\nHilda: Right, right. I'm with you so far. And then what?\nFerdinand: Now, put similar items together. That makes it easier to get a handle on the numbers.\nHilda: I see! Then what?\nFerdinand: Now that you have arranged everything you can begin counting. See how easy it is?\nHilda: Wow! You did that in no time! You really saved my neck there. Thanks, Ferdinand. Bye!\nFerdinand: It was nothing! I... Oh. I suppose I ended up doing her work after all._Hilda: Ferdinand. There you are!\nFerdinand: Stay back, Hilda! I will no longer entertain your clever little requests. Your wiles will not work this time!\nHilda: You shouldn't yell at a noble maiden. It's a no-no, etiquette-wise. By way of an apology, you may brew me some tea.\nFerdinand: I am sorry to have offended you, but delightful as it sounds, I will not be brewing any tea at present. Besides, I taught you how to do it before. You should be able to do it on your own, so why don't you?\nHilda: You did show me how to do it, but I can't do it as well as you.\nFerdinand: And why not?\nHilda: You selected just the right leaves, and you boiled them just right. You even considered the room temperature and humidity. Then you set out just the right pot, along with the right cups. You immediately picked out a design that you knew I would like. When you poured, the temperature, the timing, and the technique were all impeccable.\nFerdinand: Hm. You seem to know an awful lot about tea, for someone who cannot even pour it.\nHilda: Oh, uh, not really! Maybe I picked up a couple of things from watching you. Even the sound of the liquid pouring into the cups was like music. Taken as a whole, it was an almost spiritual experience. A symphony for the senses.\nFerdinand: I was just making tea in the traditional fashion.\nHilda: Oh, I'm so flustered, I'm not getting my point across. I'm trying to say that... Your tea is like love. You're devoted to bringing happiness to those who drink it. I could taste that from the first drop.\nFerdinand: Well... When serving another, one must put in a little bit of love. But I must say, you surprise me. Not many are so attentive to the finer points of tea. I made quite the impression on you! Perhaps I ought to pour you another cup.\nHilda: Really? Oh thank you, Ferdinand.\nFerdinand: I shall find us a suitable brew. Wait here a moment.\nFerdinand walks away\n\nHilda: Haha! Oh, Ferdinand! So simple. And yet... so kind._Hilda: Oh dear, I'm thirsty again. If only I had a drink.\nFerdinand: I have some tea. You are welcome to drink some.\nScreen fades to black and changes\n\nHilda: Oh dear! I forgot to get my—\nFerdinand: I found it. Here it is.\nScreen fades to black and changes\n\nHilda: Oh dear! I didn't return my library book!\nFerdinand: I returned your book a little while ago.\nHilda: Oh. Thank you. Ferdinand, how did you get so good at doing things for me? It's like you know what I need before I do.\nFerdinand: I have lots of practice fielding your requests. All I need to do is think for a bit, and I know what you need. I can practically read your mind.\nHilda: Oh, you know what it's like in here, huh? OK. Tell me what I'm thinking about right now.\nFerdinand: Hmm... You want a snack.\nHilda: Sorry! Nice try. Actually, I was thinking... I've become quite fond of you.\nFerdinand: I suppose that is inevitable. I am rather fond of you as well. I find your laziness endearing.\nHilda: Hey, the \"fond\" thing was just a joke! Really I was thinking about tea. Kinda thirsty.\nFerdinand: I admire you, Hilda.\nHilda: You what?\nFerdinand: I said, I admire you. You are gifted and accomplished. I used to underestimate you.\nHilda: I said I was kidding, didn't I? This is all a bit—\nFerdinand: You feign sloth to obscure the considerable breadth and depth of your talents. Such delicate discretion, such noble prudence! If only I could emulate it.\nHilda: I've never been called prudent before, but...I like hearing you say it. Thank you. You're good at giving compliments. In return for all your help, I promise that I'll keep being prudent.\nFerdinand: I appreciate that. Shall we go?\nHilda: Huh? Go where?\nFerdinand: I thought you wanted some tea! The dining hall is the place for that.\nHilda: Oh, Ferdinand! You're too kind._Hilda: Wow I am thirsty. I could really go for something to drink.\nFerdinand: Hilda! There you are.\nHilda: Hey, Ferdinand! Thanks for your help earlier.\nFerdinand: I do not desire your gratitude. I have a bone to pick with you. At the library, you pawned your job off on me!\nHilda: Actually, I never asked you to do the whole thing. You started teaching me how, and got carried away. Meanwhile, I was just awestruck by your cleverness and generosity.\nFerdinand: Ah, well... Hey, wait a moment! Your charms won't work this time. You were just using me.\nHilda: Aw, that hurts my feelings. I really was awestruck. If I had to arrange all the library supplies on my own, I'd have been there past nightfall.\nFerdinand: With a steady pace, you would have finished by twilight at the latest.\nHilda: Oh, no. I'm not competent enough, honestly. I don't even know how to make a cup of tea.\nFerdinand: You're quite a defeatist, Hilda. I... H-hold a moment. Did you just say you cannot make tea?\nHilda: That's right. I can't touch things that get hot. I'm always scared of getting burned.\nFerdinand: Trust me, it is not difficult. You just need to be cautious as you are pouring. I can teach you.\nHilda: Really? Great! Please teach me, Ferdinand.\nFerdinand: This is a crucial skill for nobles, Hilda. If nothing else, you must learn the art of tea brewing.\nBackground fades to black with a picture of a cup of tea.\n\nFerdinand: Look here. You bring the water to a boil, and you put the leaves in here... All right, that should be enough time steeping. Now we can drain the water, pour the tea, and enjoy.\nBackground returns to Ferdinand and Hilda\n\nHilda: That took longer than I expected. Well, thanks. Bottoms up!\nFerdinand: You may have to steep it for more time or less, depending on the leaves. From now on, you can—\nHilda: Mm. That really hit the spot! Thanks. I'm a slow learner, so I hope you'll teach me again sometime.\nHilda runs off\n\nFerdinand: She...she fooled me again! That was the last time, I swear it._C+_null_
17_18_Flayn: What is that lovely smell? It seems to be coming from the training area... What could it be?\nFerdinand: Hngh! You have met your match, rust! Ach... So stubborn.\nFlayn: Good day to you, Ferdinand. You smell amazing. That is you I am smelling, is it not?\nFerdinand: Ah, Flayn, hello! Are you referring to the smell of this oil?\nFlayn: Aha! Yes, that is the smell, all right!\nFerdinand: I am simply doing some armor maintenance. A little oil keeps the rust at bay, ensuring that the armor moves smoothly, without any hitches.\nFlayn: I see. I thought maybe you were doing some cooking — you smell a bit like food. But I suppose that is the oil tricking my nose.\nFerdinand: I would not cook in the training area. Are you hungry by chance?\nFlayn: Not really, no...But is that oil not also used for cooking? For things like frying meat or drizzling a nice, crisp salad. Things of that nature? Were I to coat my armor in oil that smells of food, I would be distracted by hunger at all times!\nFerdinand: I doubt that amidst actual fighting, the smell would still make you hungry. We are always dancing with death on the battlefield. When your focus wavers, your life is forfeit.\nFlayn: I suppose you are right. And actually... all this talk of delicious oil has made me hungry!\nFerdinand: In that case, I will accompany you to the dining hall. I will be finished in a couple of minutes...\nFlayn: I must apologize, Ferdinand, but I cannot wait even a moment for you. I am famished! I shall be in the dining hall, getting my fill of fried goodies!\nFerdinand: Well, that was quick. Hmm... I will admit, now that I she has mentioned it, it is a rather appetizing smell._Ferdinand: ...\nFlayn: Good day, Ferdinand! Working on your armor again?\nFerdinand: Good day to you too! That is right. I have been overusing it a bit lately. Now, allow me to wager a guess. Are you feeling hungry, as usual?\nFlayn: As usual? It is not as though I am always searching for a meal! I just... I am rather interested in armor! Do you mind if I peer over your shoulder while you work?\nFerdinand: Of course not. Please, feel free to observe.\nFlayn: Thank you for allowing me the pleasure! Ooooo! So many different types! Wow! Helmets, armor, gauntlets... The range of defensive items seems innumerable! This one seems different from the rest of them. It is akin to a gauntlet, except—\nFerdinand: Flayn! Careful!\nFlayn: Huh? Ahh! (screen cuts to black while a metallic noise is heard)\nFerdinand: Flayn! Are you all right? Did you injure yourself?\nFlayn: I am well... But what was that?\nFerdinand: That could have been serious! Please forgive me. I should have warned you first. This is a new type of gauntlet with a spring-loaded blade over the knuckles. The mechanism is rather easily triggered. How foolish of me not to warn you...\nFlayn: No, I am the one who was overly curious and reached out without permission. My apologies. But... um... when you snatched me out of harm's way, you... er... embraced me quite tightly...\nFerdinand: Ah, yes. You were in danger and my instincts simply took hold. I hope you will forgive my rashness.\nFlayn: No, it is not that at all! It is just... you hugged me so tight...\nFerdinand: Did it hurt? I am so sorry, Flayn. I did not mean to cause you any discomfort.\nFlayn: Not at all! Not— not in the slightest... Anyway, I had better be on my way.(Flayn leaves)\nFerdinand: Such a delicate creature. And that sweet demeanor... Agh! Snap out of it, Ferdinand!_Ferdinand: Flayn, I hope you will allow me to apologize.\nFlayn: Why would you need to do that?\nFerdinand: Last time, when I was working on my armor, you could have been gravely injured. You have been avoiding me ever since, so I want to reiterate how very sorry I am.\nFlayn: I'm not sure that's entirely the case...\nFerdinand: So, you are not avoiding me?\nFlayn: To be perfectly honest, I felt a bit embarrassed. When you embraced me before, it really caught me off guard. You're surprisingly strong for how slender you appear. Anyway, it all got me rather flustered.\nFerdinand: Oh, I see. Well... I do train quite often. On the battlefield, it is perfectly common to lift up a wounded comrade. It has nothing to do with your gender. In the heat of the moment, I pay no attention to such things! That is, uh, how I would explain it.\nFlayn: I see! So you have a well of strength for embracing people, it seems!\nFerdinand: Well, I would not put it like that. Usually when I embrace people, it is in the context of battle.\nFlayn: Is that so? Ah, so the embrace was nothing more than a rescue. Perhaps I was flustered needlessly. I wonder... if you would consider embracing me when my life is not in peril?\nFerdinand: Huh? Why?\nFlayn: Because I'd like to feel that way again. That's why. How about it? Or is your capacity for embracing limited exclusively to warfare?\nFerdinand: Uh... Oh! I see what is going on here. I had forgotten how charmingly ethereal you can be... Very well. As per your request, I shall embrace you again.\nFlayn: Ah! I'm delighted! Does right now work for you?\nFerdinand: Why, of course! Easily done. Although, perhaps we shouldn't tell Seteth...\nFlayn: Agreed. Better to let this be our little secret._null_null_null_
17_31_Ferdinand: My princess is lovely, my princess is fair, She sings like sweet cicadas in midsummer's air—\nManuela: Cicadas? Those noisy little bugs that swarm about? Endlessly mingling with one another?\nFerdinand: Oh! Good point. I will revise... My princess is lovely, my princess is fair, She sings like a swallow in midsummer's air—\nManuela: Migrating birds... Never stick around for long. Always off to find love somewhere else...\nFerdinand: No! Wh-what I meant was, ah, hm...\nManuela: Oh, Ferdinand. You're just not yourself today. You don't seem focused. Your poetry...lacks poetry. Perhaps a break is in order.\nFerdinand: I would not dream of stopping now. This is my golden opportunity!\nManuela: Pardon me?\nFerdinand: We are finally alone. Just the two of us.\nManuela: Why...yes. We are, aren't we?\nFerdinand:You see, Manuela, I have long admired you.\nManuela: Is that a fact?\nFerdinand: I saw you perform countless times while you were with the opera company.\nManuela: (laughs) I see. So, what did you think?\nFerdinand: The figure you cut, that heartbreaking voice... I was mesmerized. That is why I am tongue-tied. I am nervous about speaking to you alone, after idolizing you for so long.\nManuela: There's no need to be nervous, Ferdinand. That songstress you recall...is long gone. I get nervous too, you know. But I want you to feel relaxed around me. Understood?\nFerdinand: Yes! Uh, ahem... Yes, I promise to try.\nManuela: You're really full of surprises, you know that? I assumed you'd be more interested in combat than the arts. Come and chat sometime? I'd love to hear more about how my performances mesmerized you._Manuela: Hmm... Let's see... Has to be here somewhere...\nFerdinand: Oh, my princess! Pray tell, are you seeking a book?\nManuela: Ferdinand... You should probably settle down a little with the \"princess\" talk. Just speak to me normally. My \"princess\" days are long gone.\nFerdinand: I could not disagree more! To me, you will always be that dazzling songstress, that veritable princess of the opera. From ages five to eleven, I never missed a single one of your performances. Seeing you on stage was like glimpsing heaven. I was overcome with bliss.\nManuela: You're going a little overboard. And I... I think I may have something in my eye.\nFerdinand: An elegant coalescence of beautiful song and frenetic swordplay. That was the most memorable aspect for me. Onstage, weapon in hand, letting your ballad soar to the heavens... Honestly, the first time I held a sword, it was not to train. I was trying to do your sword dance.\nManuela: I inspired your love of weaponry? How...flattering?\nFerdinand: Correct! It is all thanks to you.\nManuela: Oh, come now... Although I'm honored if my stage presence had any such influence on your life.\nFerdinand: The honor is all mine. You blessed me by returning to my life. No matter where I go, or who I end up marrying, my childhood memory of you is inscribed in the deepest depths of my heart.\nManuela: ...\nFerdinand: Is something the matter?\nManuela: Oh, nothing. I just feel a little empty inside now..._Ferdinand: ♪ How the crimson rain of pain it came, falling hard upon a land aflame. When the sacred blade it split the sky, until the heavens heard our cry... In the hour of vengeance, will you heed the call? On the red fields of revenge, will you help avenge? We must fight strong and stand tall! ♪\nManuela: Oh, Ferdinand! That song...\nFerdinand: Manuela, ah, hello! What a treat. It is most rare to see you at the training grounds. I have never had the honor of sparring with a princess. Why not grab a sword?\nManuela: Ferdinand. That's called changing the subject. That song you were singing, is it the one you said made such an impression on you?\nFerdinand: So, you heard me... I hope it was not too grating on your ears.\nManuela: You've nothing at all to be embarrassed about! I'm pleased if one of my songs stayed with you like that. Ahhh, it really takes me back. I remember the big battle in the first act...\n♪ How the crimson rain of pain it came, falling hard upon a land aflame. When the sacred blade it split the sky, until the heavens heard our cry... In the hour of vengeance, will you heed the call? On the red fields of revenge, will you help avenge? We must fight strong and stand tall! ♪\nManuela: Wow. My heyday is behind me, that's for sure.\nFerdinand: No, that was...wonderful! Exactly the voice I recall from my childhood. To have witnessed this performance in such an intimate setting... I am deeply moved! I cannot stop trembling. I feel as though I am going to cry. You have shaken me to my very core!\nManuela: All right, Ferdinand. Relax. I can see that it's affected you deeply.\nFerdinand: You made a little boy's cherished dream come true. Perhaps you can help realize one more.\nManuela: Another one? And what would that be?\nFerdinand: (bows) Would you do the sword dance with me—the one that accompanied the song? It had a part for a male performer if I recall. I would be truly honored.\nManuela: I'm sure I can't do it as well now as I could then. But you're just so adorably...you. I can't resist.\nScreen fades to black with flashes of swords clashing\n\nFerdinand: (bows) Thank you so much. That has long been a dream of mine, and you made it a reality.\nManuela: I gotta say, Ferdinand, you're full of surprises. It was like dancing with a pro. Perfect timing, always in step...\nFerdinand: All thanks to you. You inspired me.\nManuela: Or perhaps it was you who inspired me._null_null_null_
