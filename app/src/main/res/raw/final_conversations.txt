15_You're always so calm._Disagree_Sigh_Sip tea
15_One day, I'll show you around the palace in Enbarr. It has a lovely garden._Nod_-_-
15_Here I can take a break from the burden of being emperor. Perhaps that's why I'm so comfortable with you._Nod_Laugh_Blush
15_I have no intention of handing the Imperial throne over to any child I might have. Instead, I'll choose an outsider who's brilliant and kind._Commend_Chat_Praise
16_Crests, lineage, knighthood... Trifles. Skill and survival are the only things that matter._Nod_Commend_Chat

16_Spending time with you is... not bad._Laugh_Blush_-
16_Join me for sword training again. I want to know my victory isn't a fluke._Nod_Commend_-
16_I'm always thinking about wars, but this room feels so peaceful._Laugh_-_-
16_Well... I appreciate all that you do for me._Laugh_Blush_-
17_You have a way of making people feel comfortable. I almost cannot help telling you everything._Disagree_Blush_-
17_Since I was a child, I have loved riding horses and fighting. People used to tell me to act more like a noble._Laugh_Commend_-
17_You often hear stories of nobles and commoners in love. I am not against such things, but reality is not so simple._Nod_Commend_Chat
17_When I am unhappy, I try to bestow happiness upon others. Such is the way of the true noble._Sigh_Chat_Praise
17_You treat everyone the same, regardless of status. Perhaps I should do that as well._Commend_Blush_Praise
17_I am extremely versatile. In fact, I fear I am a jack-of-all-trades._Laugh_Disagree_Praise
17_I suppose the Sword of the Creator never goes dull, so you do not need to sharpen it._Nod_Chat_-
17_You will always remember me, will you not?_Sip tea_Blush_-
17_Hmm. It can be good to relax now and then. Shall we play a game?_Nod_Laugh_-

19_I've served the royal family for decades, and marched through history by their side._Nod_Sigh_-
19_I am an unforgivable sinner. I do not deserve a peaceful life._Disagree_Praise_-
19_No judge, not even the goddess herself, will bring me to justice. Though I deserve it._Sigh_Praise_-
19_It's true that strength alone will not make you powerful. Yet you will not become powerful without it._Chat_-_-
19_The Holy Kingdom of Faerghus is the nation of proud knights. I love that country... and miss it deeply._Nod_-_-
19_I am sorry, but relaxing is... not a skill I possess._Laugh_Praise_-
20_The 'Ashen Demon.' What an unbelievable title, knowing who you are now... _Disagree_Sip tea_-
20_Since I have never found out the secret of your birth, I am exceptionally intrigued._Chat_Blush_-

20_I never can stop talking about Crests, can I? Don't you dare laugh at me._Laugh_Admonish_-
20_Can't be helped. I'll tell you about my favorite food again. Or perhaps we should talk about drinks?_Laugh_Admonish_Sip tea
21_You're in no hurry to wrap this up. Don't you have some actual, y'know... work to do?_Laugh_Disagree_Sip tea
21_I'm feeling a bit sleepy... Oh, not that you're boring or anything._Sigh_Chat_-
21_Right now I feel so... free. It's nice._Nod_Chat_-
21_I haven't seen my parents for more than a decade. I can't remember what they look like..._Admonish_Chat_Praise
21_I saw you playing with a cat earlier. How did you manage that? Cats always run away from me..._Chat_Sip tea_Blush
21_Did you know people can sigh simply because they're happy? Not much risk of me doing that._Nod_Chat_-
21_Sometimes I have regrets about my choices, but... right now, I'm just grateful to be here._Nod_Commend_Praise

23_Sometimes your insights are so keen they seem to border on precognition._Disagree_Sip tea_-
23_House Vestra is one of few noble houses not to lay claim to any territory._Commend_Chat_-

28_Please wake me if I fall asleep. I don't wish to be a rude guest._Admonish_Sip tea_-
28_They say the Crest's power dwells in blood. So why does it have to be so disgusting?_Admonish_Chat_-

30_Talking to you feels worth my time. I feel there's a lot I can learn from you._Laugh_Blush_-
30_I wonder what I'd do, who I'd be, if I gave everything up for freedom. I think about that all the time._Nod_Chat_-
