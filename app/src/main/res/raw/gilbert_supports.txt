19_41_Gilbert: I am sorry to make you tag along with my shopping trip like this. You were very kind to offer your help, even though this is my duty.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Don't worry about it.\nChoice 2: I'm happy to help.\nGilbert:\nChoice 1 response: I will someday repay you for this kindness.\nChoice 2 response: In return, I will gladly come to your aid when you need it someday.\nGilbert: Though I fear there may not be so many things I can help you with...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Could you teach me to fish?\nChoice 2: Could you help me with my combat training?\nGilbert:\nChoice 1 response: Fishing? Of course, I would be happy to. I recall hearing that Captain Jeralt is quite the fisherman. Is that true?\nChoice 2 response: I would be glad to. However, I would likely learn more from you, than you would from me.\nGilbert: You made a living as a mercenary under Captain Jeralt's guidance. As a comparatively new member of the Knights of Seiros, I was not so familiar with his past exploits... Yet clashing swords with him, even just a handful of times, was enough for his abilities to astound me. You, as one trained by him, must have those same great talents. I have devoted my life to the path of a knight, yet I find your mercenary experience lends your blade...\n(Gilbert looks away.)\n\nByleth: Hm?\nCity Child: Ahaha, wait up!\nCity Child: Catch me if you can! C'mon, this way! This way!\n(Children run away.)\n\nGilbert: Hah... It is good to see children able to play and to smile.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's rare to see that look on your face.\nChoice 2: I never knew you could smile, Gilbert.\nGilbert: Was I...smiling?\n(Byleth nods.)\n\nGilbert: Please...forget you saw that. I do not have the right to such pleasures.\nByleth: The right?\nGilbert: Indeed... For those we have lost will never be able to smile again. (Pause.) I am sorry. I did not mean to trouble you with such talk. Come, let us head back._Gilbert: Dear Goddess, please allow His Majesty to rest in peace…\n(Byleth enters)\n\nGilbert: Who is it? Oh... Professor. What brings you here at this hour?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I heard your voice.\nChoice 2: I was just taking a walk.\nGilbert:\nChoice 1 response: I am most sorry for disturbing you.\nChoice 2 response: n/a\nGilbert: The hour is late, Professor. You should be resting in preparation for the day to come.\nByleth: What were you doing?\nGilbert: I was offering my prayers to the goddess. It is all that I can do now... I told you I was in service of the royal family, yes? When I was only a young soldier, the king saw fit to make a knight of me. I was given the great honor of guiding and protecting the royal family.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Guiding?\nChoice 2: Protecting?\nGilbert:\nChoice 1 response: It was similar to your own work. I was a teacher of sorts.\nChoice 2 response: Indeed. I served in that post for nearly 40 years.\nGilbert: I instructed both King Lambert and Prince Dimitri in the arts of combat, tactics, and academia. I also did all in my power to keep them safe. Until… That day. I was unable to fulfill my duty. I was...powerless.\nByleth: You mean...the Tragedy of Duscur?\nGilbert: Yes. When I received word of the attack, it was already too late. His Majesty was dead, along with many knights and soldiers. If only I had made it to Duscur more quickly... It is my fault that His Highness, Dimitri, has become...the way he is now. After that, I abandoned my wife and child, and fled my homeland. I turned my back on everything I swore to protect. My sins are countless. I will bear the weight of my guilt for as long as I live.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Praying to the goddess won't help.\nChoice 2: You're going about this the wrong way.\nGilbert: What else can I do for His Majesty and all of those who died that day? Apologizing to my daughter and wife. Devoting myself to His Highness. That is the way to atonement. And yet... Even if I am granted the forgiveness of those who still live, praying is all I can do to atone to those who are with us no more…\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Praying won't help you atone.\nChoice 2: The dead are gone. You can't help them now.\nGilbert: …\nGilbert: Long ago, there was someone who told me something quite similar. Forgive me. This will not do. As I grow older, I find myself talking endlessly about the past. But it is too late for such things now. I have finished my prayers. We should return._Gilbert: Even this town, which was a ruin, has begun to recover its energy. However, acquiring supplies is still difficult. The people living here are struggling too. This conflict must be brought to an end soon.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Let's end it ourselves.\nChoice 2: I quite agree.\nGilbert:\nChoice 1 response: I agree. We must seize victory with our own hands.\nChoice 2 response: Yes. Let us seize victory together and build a new, more peaceful world.\nGilbert: Still, I wonder what path my life should follow once we achieve our goals.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Aren't you going back to your home?\nChoice 2: Aren't you going back to your family?\nGilbert: This has been my intent. However, I sometimes find myself thinking differently. I wonder if it is time for my role here to end. Our peaceful future would hardly benefit from a war-hardened relic such as myself. That has been my intent. But surely my daughter, Annette, must have her own path to follow. Perhaps she would be happier if our paths diverged. Of course, if she desires it, I will gladly return. But if she does not… Hmm... I wonder if I should ask my wife to join me here, to live out our days together at the monastery. That would not be so bad a choice either. Perhaps it is the fault of last night's drink that I am indulging in such dreams of the future today.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's important to think about the future.\nChoice 2 response: This isn't like you, Gilbert.\nGilbert: Yes. I've learned there is strength in focusing clearly on tomorrow and allowing yesterday to be done. You are correct. For now, I should focus on surviving the battles at hand. Hmm.\n(two children appear)\n\nCity Child B: Hey! It's the old fishing guy! Hi there!\nByleth: Old fishing guy?\nGilbert: A short time ago, I instructed these children in the art of fishing.\nCity Child A: Thanks to you, we caught a really, really big fish in the river nearby!\nGilbert: Is that right? Be sure you share it with your families, now.\nCity Child B: We will!\n(children leave)\n\nByleth: What happened to not smiling?\nGilbert: I did say something about that once, didn't I? I even told you to forget you ever saw me smile… But now, I would not ask that of you... Your words from when last we spoke have stayed with me. They bring to mind the king I first served. He told me not to dwell upon the dead. \"The dead are dead, and those who live are not bound by them.\" I intend to live my own life from now on.\nByleth: That's a fine smile.\nGilbert: You have a fine smile as well. One that I could never have imagined when we first met. No matter how our titles or positions change, I hope you will always remain yourself, Professor._null_null_Gilbert: This place never changes. Even though Lady Rhea has withdrawn from duty, and you have become the new archbishop. The monastery that was in ruins has been rebuilt. The continent is united under its rightful king. Amidst all that change, this place stays the same.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Are you going to stay at the monastery?\nChoice 2: You're not going back home?\nGilbert: I have been considering what to do for some time, and I have chosen to remain here. Of course, I have obtained His Majesty's blessing in this. He told me I should live as I see fit. I believe this soldier's duty has come to an end. It feels lonely, yet I think it is a good thing. And remaining at the monastery does not mean severing all ties with my daughter. I fully intend to visit my wife and child whenever possible. There is one other thing. My youth may be gone, but I would like to offer you my service as a knight. If you will have me.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm counting on you.\nChoice 2: You're sure that's what you want?\nGilbert: I would choose to serve none other. The war is over, yet there are still difficulties to face. We of the church must join hands with the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus to make a better world for all. I am unsure how much I can do for you. But I hope I can form a bridge between the church and the Kingdom. Aside from that... I suppose I can at least teach the orphans at the monastery to fish. Oh, I nearly forgot something very important.\nByleth: Something important?\nGilbert: Yes… I would like to put an end to the deception that has been my life. Your Grace, I humbly request that you call me by my true name. I am Gustave Eddie Dominic.\nByleth: I'm counting on you, Gustave.\nGilbert: Yes, my liege.\nGilbert: I hereby swear my allegiance to you. Unwavering and forevermore. On my honor as a knight, I will shield you from all troubles. I swear from this day forth to protect your life... and your smile.

19_20_Gilbert: Hngh! Hahh! Hyahh! Yahh!\nHanneman: Why, it's Gilbert. Training on a day off? That man will never change...nor rest, apparently. Is there any need to be so diligent when nobody is watching? Ah well, at least I can bear witness.\nGilbert: Hrngh! Hyahh! Hahh! Ungh!\nHanneman: ...\nGilbert: Professor Hanneman. Is there something you need?\nHanneman: Ah, you noticed me. No, no, not at all. I was simply observing. I apologize for disturbing you.\nGilbert: You've done nothing worthy of apology. Although I fail to understand why you would watch my training.\nHanneman: Oh, well, I watch because I find it quite interesting. Your movements are most refined, with no unnecessary motions. Elegant is the word, I think. I find it quite satisfying to observe. In fact, I might say I was mesmerized.\nGilbert: Is that so.\nHanneman: If only you showed a bit more emotion on your face, just to sell the rest of it. You come off a bit tense.\nGilbert: Training is difficult. A strain on the body. Surely it is natural for one to be...tense.\nHanneman: Oh, I know well how difficult training can be. But in your case, it's as though you're punishing yourself.\nGilbert: I am sorry. It's simply how I am.\nHanneman: No, no, what do I know of your training? My criticism was, perhaps, unnecessary. Still, I do feel you are too hard on yourself. Would it not be easier to live a little more freely? Find something that makes you happy and embrace it wholeheartedly. It would do you a world of good.\nGilbert: I thank you for your advice, Professor Hanneman. But I cannot live as you do. Such a way of life...is not permitted to me. Now, if you will pardon me, I will return to my training.\nHanneman: Not permitted? I think the only one not permitting you joy, dear Gilbert, is yourself._Hanneman: Your face looks stiff as ever, Gilbert.\nGilbert: As I said before, I cannot change my nature.\nHanneman: Understood. And I suppose seeing you train with an expression of glee would be rather unsettling. Still, you've finished for the day, yes? Would you join me for tea, and perhaps a chat?\nGilbert: Professor Hanneman, may I ask a question first?\nHanneman: Certainly. Ask away. I'll answer whatever is within my power to do so.\nGilbert: Why concern yourself with me? I have no Crests. I am of no particular use to you.\nHanneman: Whatever are you talking about? I don't speak to you out of some ulterior motive. Certainly, I have previously approached others because of my research interests... That is not the case here. I merely wish to get to know you.\nGilbert: You wish to know me?\nHanneman: Yes! It is not often I have the opportunity to find friends my own age, you see.\nGilbert: ...\nHanneman: Well, regardless of how you feel, speaking for myself, I already consider you something of a friend. You must have heard of my tenacity. It will prove easier if you accept my offer of friendship now!\nGilbert: Ha.\nHanneman: Was that a laugh? A rarity for you, Gilbert. Can I take that to mean we are friends indeed?\nGilbert: I see no reason not to be so.\nHanneman: Well, I am honored. Then, as a first step, I would like it if we could find a common interest. A hobby to engage in. Something the younger folk would not appreciate, and may even be irritated by.\nGilbert: Haha, I look forward to it.\nHanneman: Another laugh! I must say we may make a better duo than I first expected._null_null_null_null_

Please excuse me.\nManuela: No, Gilbert. Hold on a moment. You're not disturbing me. Truly. I want very much to know what you thought of my singing. The least you can do is tell me.\nGilbert: You were lovely. Y-you sounded lovely.\nManuela: Lovely? Is that what you really feel? Please be honest.\nGilbert: Why would you suppose I was dishonest?\nManuela: That is not the look of someone who just heard what they deemed to be lovely. It hurts my confidence when my voice can't even lure a fleeting smile to your face. It's as though my singing voice has died since stepping off the Mittelfrank stage...\nGilbert: My lady Manuela, that could be no further from the truth.\nManuela: If that's the case, then, Gilbert, I challenge you to a duel!
