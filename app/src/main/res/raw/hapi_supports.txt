21_41_Hapi: Well, look who it is. How are you, Chatterbox? Gotten the hang of the whole teaching thing yet?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I would say so.\nChoice 2: Not really, no.\nHapi (Choice 1): That makes sense. You certainly strut around here like someone who belongs. You seem like one of those people who blends in. I could see you just about anywhere and think, \"Oh, that person's here. Makes sense.\"\nHapi: (Choice 2): Oh, you're still finding your footing? That's not really the impression I got. You seem like one of those people who blends in. I could see you just about anywhere and think, \"Oh, that person's here. Makes sense.\"\nByleth: Um. Thanks?\nHapi: I wasn't paying you some sort of compliment. To me, it doesn't matter whether or not you believe in the goddess. You're here supporting the church, and that makes you no different from the others. I can't stand that.\nByleth: Sorry about that.\nHapi: No need to apologize. I just have a rocky history with the church, is all. They betayed me, or at any rate, horribly mistreated me. So I'm not a huge fan. But keep that to yourself.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You were mistreated?\nChoice 2: You were betrayed?\nHapi: When I was little, a lady locked me up and held me captive for a long time. The Knights of Seiros rescued me - promised to protect me. But they hid me away in Abyss. So all the knights did was move me from one cage to another. Wouldn't you call that mistreatment? It was all for the greater good. They didn't want to put anyone important in danger. As for me, my life was expendable. That guy Alois was nice to me, though. And he told me a bunch of hilarious jokes to cheer me up.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sounds like him.\nChoice 2: ...Hilarious?\nHapi:\nChoice 1 response: I was being sarcastic. Alois wouldn't know a good joke if it landed in his mustache. Anyway, that's why I hate the church. Someday you'll hate them, too. They only hired you because they needed a warm body to fill the post. When you're of no use to them, they'll get rid of you without a second thought.\nChoice 2 response: Do they not have sarcasm where you come from? Keep up. Anyway, that's why I hate the church. Someday you'll hate them, too. They only hired you because they needed a warm body to fill the post. When you're of no use to them, they'll get rid of you without a second thought.\nByleth: ...\nHapi: Sorry, that sounded more menacing than I intended. I'm just telling you how these people think. They have rules, dogma. They want us all bound to their system so they can control us. I don't do well with that sort of stuff. That's why I ran away from home in the first place.\nByleth: Ran away?\nHapi: Yeah. Ran far, far away. But as far as I ran, it wasn't far enough. I got dragged back into society, chains and all. The kind of world I want doesn't exist.\nByleth: \nChoice 1: ...\nChoice 2: I don't think that's true.\nHapi: I'm getting too dark for you aren't I? Forget I said anything. Your future looks bright, at least. You can just sit back and enjoy whatever comes your way. I'm just saying, don't rest your entire future on the church. It's not as steady a foundation as it seems. Anyway, that's all. I'll be going now._Hapi: Oh, Chatterbox, it's you. Do you need this room for something? Should I leave?\nByleth: \nChoice 1: Why would you leave?\nChoice 2: You can stay.\nHapi: What do you mean? With me here, you won't be able to focus on whatever you're doing.\nByleth: It'll be fine. Just stay.\nHapi: All right...if you're sure. You're a strange one, you know that? When I came in earlier, people couldn't leave fast enough. They ran away like I was a bad smell. I should be used to that sort of thing by know, but... Well, it stung a little bit.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's terrible.\nChoice 2: Why would they leave?\nHapi:\nChoice 1 response: I almost don't blame them. Everyone must have heard the rumors by now.\nChoice 2 response: Are you making fun of me? I'm sure you've heard the rumors, just like everyone else.\nHapi: A girl who summons monsters when she sighs. That's not the kind of thing people keep to themselves. Anyway, I prefer solitude. It's easier that way.\nByleth: Are the rumors true?\nHapi: You really didn't know? Yeah, the rumors are true as heck. That's why the knights stuck me in Abyss. If anything was going to happen, better down there than up here. That was the idea anyway.\nByleth: I see...\nHapi: Oh, you had that look on your face. That \"yikes, get this creep away from me\" look. It's OK, I'll leave. Look how dangerous I am, after all. You wouldn't want to be left alone with someone like me. Who knows? Maybe I'll get exasperated, and without thinking, I'll start to - Huuuh...\nByleth: ...\nHapi: ...aaaahhhh...\nByleth: It was just a yawn. That's a relief.\nHapi: Sorry to scare you, Chatterbox. I don't usually do that. Guess I haven't been getting enough sleep. Everyone talking about me like I'm some sort of freak... It's been bothering me.\nByleth: You're worrying me.\nHapi: It doesn't matter. Gossip is petty and a waste of energy, so there's no need for me to pay it any mind.\nByleth: Still...\nHapi: The funny thing is all this drama has made me more likely to lose my cool. If that happens, you'll help me out, right?\nByleth: I'll do what I can._Hapi: Oh, hey. I've been meaning to speak with you.\nByleth: What about?\nHapi: I heard that you've been telling people not to worry so much about my condition. Is that a fact?\nByleth: ...Maybe.\nHapi: No need to be coy. Thanks for doing that. But I do have one more minor concern... You said that I haven't sighed in five years?! What the heck is that about? Everyone's calling me \"Half Decade Hapi\" now! First of all, terrible nickname. Second of all, you weren't even here. Did you just make that up?\nByleth:\nOption 1: No, I asked around.\nOption 2: ...Maybe.\nHapi: You asked around?! That's such a weird thing to do. I'm fighting the urge to sigh right now!\nByleth: I thought I was helping...\nHapi: Well, the nickname's bogus. I have absolutely sighed in the last five years. You wouldn't believe what a hassle it was. Monsters rampaging willy-nilly through Abyss. Thanks to some help from the people underground, no one got hurt, but it was a close call. Maybe if you had been there. it wouldn't have been so much trouble.\nByleth: Me?\nHapi: Yes, you. You've got the Sword of the Creator. That thing can chop through monsters like nothing. \nByleth: Is that all?\nHapi: Are you fishing for compliments now? Fine. You're a good leader. You watch out for all of us. Even when the rest of the world turns and hides from me, I know you've got my back. \nByleth: That's true.\nHapi: You make me feel safe. Like I can be myself. Like I don't have to worry so much about keeping my emotions in check. I felt pretty sad all that time you were gone. I could've left Garreg Mach altogether. But then I started thinking...you might still be alive, after all. So I went looking for you. Back to where you'd fallen and all.\nByleth:\nOption 1: You did that for me?\nOption 2: You really care about me, huh?\nHapi: Ugh! Forget I said anything. Look at me getting all mushy and sincere. How embarassing. Let's just go back to earlier when I was giving you a hard time.\nByleth: Don't be embarrassed.\nHapi: Hey, I can feel embarrassed if I want to! I can feel however I wanna feel! Whoa. Did I really just say that? I think that's enough vulnerability for one day. I'll see you around._null_null_Hapi: This is quite a place. Whatever you wanted to tell me must be pretty important.\nByleth: It is.\nHapi: OK, what's going on? You're making a weird face. It's freaking me out.\n(Crimson Flower)\n(Azure Moon) You're going to be the new archbishop, right? Let's talk about that.\n(Verdant Wind / Silver Snow) You're going to rule over all of Fódlan, right? Let's talk about that.\nByleth: Yes, but...\nHapi: This is a chance to replace the old, hollow Church of Seiros with something new - something better. In your new position, you can make that happen.\nByleth: I can certainly try.\nHapi: Then do it! Those hypocrites preached about love and decency while shoving folks like me into the shadows. That's a pretty shoddy religion in my book. You can reshape it into something that actually helps people. Not that I need any help, mind you. I can help myself just fine.\nByleth: That's true.\nHapi: Oh, there's another thing I meant to talk to you about. It's, um...um...\nByleth:\nOption 1: I have something urgent to discuss.\nOption 2: Stop trying to derail the conversation.\nHapi: You figured me out! I'm just nervous, OK? Say whatever you're going to say.\nByleth: I have something for you.\n(Byleth reveals Jeralt's ring.)\nHapi: I knew you were going to do that. I just knew it. OK, let me tell you why this is a bad idea.\nByleth: Um... Go ahead.\nHapi: You know that I'll always be coping with this... condition. This curse. It'll always be a part of my life. I feel safe with you, but you'll never feel the same with me. I'm not the kind of person you should get a cat with. Unless you want your cat to be eaten by monsters. Have you thought about all that? I know you care about me. I care about you too. I wish we could spend our lives together. But... it just wouldn't be right. I can't let you throw away your own happiness for my sake.\nByleth: Actually, Hapi...\nHapi: Hold on. You're saying that you imbued this ring with magic? An enchantment that wards off monsters... So... It negates my curse? I'm free?!\nByleth: You're free.\nHapi: Hang on. That means you weren't really proposing. And here I am, talking about getting a cat together. I almost wish a monster would appear just to save me from the embarrassment. \nByleth: Hapi. Will you marry me?\nHapi: Oh, come on! I can't handle all this will-we-won't-we stuff. My heart's going to pop out of my chest. ... All right. Thank you for giving me a second to collect myself. Yes, you weirdo. Of course I'll marry you.\nByleth: I'm so happy.\nHapi: Me too. Well, obviously I'm Hapi, but I'm also... you know what I mean. I appreciate everything you've done for me. You've changed my life in more ways than one. It's hard not to fall for someone like that. Though, of course, I've had a crush on you from the get-go... Oh, forget I said that! I'm all over the place. We don't know what the future has in store for us, but... For now, maybe we can forget all that and just enjoy being together.\nByleth:\nOption 1: Of course.\nOption 2: Only for a little while.\nHapi: Good. After all, we've worked so hard to get here. Come closer, will you?\nHapi: *sigh* *siiigh* Damn, that felt good.

21_28_Hapi: Stupid rain! Go back to the stupid cloud you came from. I'm soaked... Achoo! What a pain.\nLinhardt: Hapi? Yikes, you look like you just crawled out of a lake. Here, dry yourself off. And don't just stand there, you'll catch a cold. Come on, I'll make you some tea.\nHapi: Oh. Um, OK.\nLinhardt: Huh. It's been ages since I had a nice cup of tea during a rainstorm. Pretty nice, eh?\nHapi: I don't drink tea very often. It is nice. But what does the rain have to do with anything?\nLinhardt: Doesn't rain make you want to read a book? Or rather, nap with a book on your lap. Though... I guess I'd like that no matter the weather. But then, if the book is too good, not only will I be unable to sleep, my tea would get cold... That makes brewing it a wasted effort. Ah... And that's why I don't drink tea while it rains.\nHapi: Right. Thanks for clearing that up. And thanks for the cup of tea. Well, I'm pretty much dry now. Gotta say though, I'm kinda confused.\nLinhardt: Huh? About what?\nHapi: This just seems way out of character for you. You're so focused on yourself, you've barely ever spoken to me before now.\nLinhardt: Oh, good point. Thing is, I'm not cut out for battle. If a fight breaks out, I'm only a liability. It's better for everyone if I keep my distance.\nHapi: What does fighting have to do with... Oh, I get it. You think I'm gonna sigh. You're just like the others... But if that's true, why are you acting so different?\nLinhardt: What do you mean? Use your words to make the things in your head make sense to the rest of us.\nHapi: Fine! Here's what's in my head. I don't understand why you're being nice to me. Look around us. Nobody else will risk coming near me.\nLinhardt: They're probably afraid you'll sigh, since you looked pretty rough when we came in. Makes sense. Your sighs are disastrous. If I can prevent one with a nice, lazy cup of tea, it's the least I can do.\nHapi: I see. You did it for your own sake. Well, whatever your reasons, I'm surprised that you'd even consider doing this... for me.\nLinhardt: Surprised or not, it's no skin off my back. I'll keep doing what I do regardless of anyone's expectations. Think on that. I expected you to be a hazard, but you weren't. No harm, no foul. No need to sigh.\nHapi: If only it were that simple._Linhardt: Ahhhh...\nHapi: ...Mm, that was some good sleep. How nice it is to enjoy the sunrise all by my–\nLinhardt: Good, you're finally awake.\nHapi: AH! Who's that?! Oh no, I'm falling! Oh no, I'm emoting! Calm...\nLinhardt: Wait! No! (Hapi falls onto Linhardt) That... hurt.\nHapi: You're telling me. Do you normally start your day by startling people out of trees?\nLinhardt: Not normally, no. Sorry, but I couldn't wait.\nHapi: Couldn't wait? It's so early. You must have stayed up all night.\nLinhardt: Huh, I suppose I did. How unusual. That's what happens when you get carried away with research. Then I remembered what we talked about, so I've been waiting here for you to wake up.\nHapi: Well, here I am, wide awake. How can I help you?\nLinhardt: I found an interesting document about Saint Timotheos. There are fascinating things in that place you and your buddies call home.\nHapi: Timotheos? That's–\nLinhardt: The saint whose Major Crest you bear. His bloodline was believed to have died out a thousand years ago. It's theorized that your Crest and the Crest of Lamine have similar powers. Oh, Lamine was one of the 10 Elites. Here's the best part. Turns out this Timotheos guy had the power to summon beasts.\nHapi: I'm listening.\nLinhardt: Take a look at this passage. The writing's kind of antiquated, but at least it's legible...\nHapi: ''Saint Timotheos could converse fluently with birds and land-borne beasts, and he considered these creatures his friends. He sometimes rode over hills atop an obliging deer or called wolves to encircle him in battle. His sigh, inflected with the power of the night-bringer's star, was immensely sonorous...''\nLinhardt: Nice recitation. So there you go.\nHapi: That's just how people from my village write.\nLinhardt: Is that... so. Huh. Anyway, this obviously reminded me of you and your situation. You clearly have this same astral power, but to an excessive degree. And for some reason, it only manifests for you when you sigh.\nHapi: Does that mean you can fix it?\nLinhardt: Oh goodness, no. Or, should I say, it's unlikely. There's next to no documentation about this stuff. And I don't know nearly enough about the other Crests either. And Timotheos. Again, nothing to go on. It's near impossible to unravel, so don't get your hopes up.\nHapi: Heh, you know me... I'm good at keeping my expectations nice and low._Linhardt: Ugh, this path isn't the right way either. Why do epic quests always involve a lot of legwork?\nHapi: Well, Abyss is a big place. Maybe it's time to start on your next epic quest—giving up and going home. People are dying up there, after all. We don't have time for this sort of thing.\nLinhardt: What sort of thing? You? I'd say you're way more important than the pursuit of war. More interesting too.\nHapi: Yeah, I'm the next big thing in Crestology. How flattering. You gotta stop saying things like that or someone might get the wrong idea. Lucky for you, I'm used to your weirdness by now.\nLinhardt: I'm sorry my sincerity rubbed you the wrong way. I meant what I said, but that's fine. Now back to your ability... I've discovered that this power can be attributed to your blood. The magic originates from your Crest. There have been leaps and bounds in research on summoning magic focused on an arbitrary target. The only remaining problems are perception and distance. Though it could be argued—\nHapi: Blah, blah, big words, blah. I don't even get what you're saying.\nLinhardt: You don't have to understand it to appreciate its implications. Here's the connection—once we understand your power, it's essential that we have a theoretical grasp on how to control it.\nHapi: All right, all right. I'll do my best.\nLinhardt: That...isn't as scientific as what I had in mind.\nHapi: I'll probably need your help wrapping my head around the theoretical stuff. You up for that? No pressure. Well, people might die if you say no, so some pressure, I guess?\nLinhardt: Huh? Why me?! Ugh... I guess it can't be helped. I suppose foisting this task on Professor Hanneman would be a waste of my precious efforts... This isn't what I had in mind, but I guess I'm the only man for the job, come to think of it.\nHapi: Sounds great... Hey, if you're tired, there's no shame in calling it a day and heading back to the surface.\nLinhardt: It's more walking than I expected. I've lost sleep over this. But you're way more important than a... Oh, right. You don't like me when I'm sincere. Welp, let's get on with the adventure, then. We'll check out that hidden passage next. We've got to find that book that Timotheos is said to have left behind. Come along.\nHapi: Fine. But what if we don't find the book and you can't figure out a way to solve this?\nLinhardt: I've come this far. Now I've got to see it through to the end. How will I ever nap in peace otherwise?\nHapi: Sounds like we might be stuck together for a while._null_null_null_
21_40_Hapi: ...\nYuri: ...\nHapi: This is boring. Mind if I sleep?\nYuri: You know I don't care. Night watch or not, it's still just for training purposes. Though, you'd likely get in trouble if someone sees you catching z's.\nHapi: You wouldn't wake me if someone was here? Fine then, I won't sleep.\nYuri: Your call.\nHapi: ...\nYuri: ...\nHapi: You're being so quiet, Yuri-bird. Say something.\nYuri: I don't always fill the void with my voice, you know. Sometimes it's pleasant to just enjoy the quiet and stargaze.\nHapi: No, thanks. Stargazing is a waste of time. The stars don't even stay put all year, those jerks.\nYuri: See that one? That star is home to the goddess... Yeah! Watching over us from afar.\nHapi: ...\nYuri: That's called the Blue Sea Star, but it doesn't look blue... at all, really. Wait, no. Hang on. Maybe it wasn't that one. But that big one over there–that's it... isn't it?\nHapi: You don't know the first thing about stars, do you? No one ever taught you?\nYuri: Never, no.\nHapi: Well, the Blue Sea Star is really big. It stands out. Sometimes you can't see it at all, but other times it's the brightest thing in the sky.\nYuri: Interesting! So then, which star was I pointing out just now?\nHapi: You might have to point it out again. Which constellation were you pointing at?\nYuri: Let's see... It looks a bit like a cat... No, no, that's not right. Maybe more like a fish? Or a... fishing rod!\nHapi: Hm-hm!\nYuri: What? I'm serious! See, those stars there are forming a shape that looks very much like a fishing rod.\nHapi: OK, sorry, but that looks nothing like a fishing rod. Or a cat. I'm surprised you know so little about stars. I thought you knew everything.\nYuri: Who do you think I am–the goddess herself? There is plenty I don't know. But I'm always aiming to learn more. I'm uncomfortable not... knowing things. So come on then, Hapi. Teach me about the stars.\nHapi: That'll be a pain for both of us.\nYuri: As painful as sitting here idling? It's not like you're going to sleep at this point. Clearly you know quite a bit about them–teach me.\nHapi: Fine, fine. Look up there, to the north. Your other north. See that star? That's called the King's Right Hand._Yuri: Let me get this straight. The stars aren't moving, but the ground we stand on... is?\nHapi: Yup. We're on a big round thing that's always spinning, and that's why the stars seem to move through the sky. Hard to believe, isn't it? But it's true.\nYuri: I admit I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head around it. How is it you know these things, anyway? If you were a noble, it would make sense that you'd have a formal education on all of this.\nHapi: In the village where I was born, there were people who studied the stars. They taught me.\nYuri: A village of stargazing folk, huh? Do tell. I've never heard of such a place.\nHapi: It's a... very well-hidden village. It was a small settlement deep in the forest where no one ever bothered us. I was born there, grew up there... But when I got older, I felt like I needed to see the world. I couldn't live my whole life in one place, y'know? So I struck out on my own.\nYuri: I always knew you were an odd little bird, but your birthplace makes you a rare little bird.\nHapi: Yeah, well, pretty soon after leaving her nest, this rare little bird was put in a cage. I thought it might be some kind of punishment for leaving the forest.\nYuri: What the hell? You think that because you wanted to live your life, you'd be punished? That's ridiculous. Look at this objectively—was it punishment, or was it just plain bad luck? There's nothing wrong with wanting to see the world and expand your horizons. Take me... Had I never left that gutter I call home, I'd have gone my whole life never learning how to look at the stars.\nHapi: Yeah... I left my village because I thought I'd find a better life beyond the forest. Now I'm not so sure.\nYuri: Regret is pointless. What matters is how we live right here, right now. You know?\nHapi: Yeah...\nYuri: Do you ever want to return back home?\nHapi: I could say no, but I'd be lying. I've been feeling homesick lately. Nothing happened there, for better or worse. There wasn't much to be scared of. Everyone said the outside world was dangerous, that beyond the forest, all we'd find was an early grave. That wasn't exactly true, but my life was for sure easier when I lived there. I used to spend my days fishing, hunting for pretty flowers, running around for no reason...\nYuri: A rare occurrence indeed.\nHapi: What is?\nYuri: Seeing you smile in that way. You're always so... I don't know... neutral?\nHapi: That's not true. I smile when there's something to smile about. It's strange, though. When I'm talking to you, I can't help but let my guard down. I don't like to discuss where I came from. But with you, I feel like I can open up. You know, I've been thinking a lot about my mom and dad lately. I wonder... are they even alive?\nYuri: ..._Yuri: So, Hapi. Are you going back home or what?\nHapi: That came out of nowhere. Haven't you noticed there's a war going on? I can't leave now.\nYuri: Hm, hadn't noticed, nope. Now that I have, will you head home once it's over? To check on your parents.\nHapi: No. Even after the war, I can't return. With my curse, I might destroy the whole village. I won't put them at risk like that.\nYuri: True. I want to say you could go there and everything would be dandy. The way things tend to shake out, though, it can be pretty hard not to sigh...\nHapi: What about you? You don't mind spending all this time away from...wherever you call home?\nYuri: Can't say I've spent much time thinking about it. Maybe after the war is over. I've got plenty to keep me occupied. If I drop things and head home, my people will lose respect for me. I can't have that.\nHapi: I see. I know I should visit home at some point. It's been more than a decade since I left, though. They probably think I died.\nYuri: They might. All the more reason for you to go back. I know you're scared. But if you keep your visit brief, it'll work out fine. I don't know about yours, but my mother would want to know that I'm OK.\nHapi: I suppose I could stop by for a short visit. That might be nice...\nYuri: Still worried? I can accompany you. I'm sure you'll find some use for me.\nHapi: Huh?\nYuri: You know you'll be so caught up in my lively conversations, you'll have very little time for sighing.\nHapi: ... Hmm... That plan could backfire. I might find the conversation boring, and then...\nYuri: That would never happen. I wouldn't allow for it. And on the off chance a beast does appear... Well, that'll clear up your boredom pretty quickly, won't it?\nHapi: You've got a weird sense of humor, Yuri-bird. I like that. I guess I wouldn't feel so nervous about going home if you went with me. I might even have a good time. When you're there, you feel closer to the stars. They look so clear and bright. I'd love to show you.\nYuri: Ahaha. I look forward to it. I bet we'll even see some of the stars you taught me about.\nHapi: And maybe I'll finally lay eyes on that constellation you told me about. A fishing rod, was it?_null_null_null_
