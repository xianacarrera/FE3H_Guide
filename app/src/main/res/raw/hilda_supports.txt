22_41_Hilda: Hey, Professor! What are you doing, daydreaming in a place like this? It's lucky. As spacey as you are, you're always reliable in a pinch.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I wasn't daydreaming.\nChoice 2: You were daydreaming too.\nHilda:\nChoice 1 response: Sure. Then what were you thinking about?\nChoice 2 response: Ha! Not as much as you!\nHilda: It's hard to tell what's going on in that skull of yours. Your expression is always blank. Come on... Smile! I was just playing around! Don't get mad. By the way, in the next battle, may I focus on logistical support... off the battlefield? There's no use having a weakling like me in the middle of the action. And it would bring down morale if I were killed.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're not a weakling.\nChoice 2: I want you in the action.\nHilda: Have you even seen me, Professor? Look at these noodly little arms! I should be cheering everyone on from the sidelines. It'll certainly improve the boys' morale, don't you think?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Why aren't you taking this seriously?\nChoice 2: Why don't you want to fight?\nHilda: Because even if I do, I won't be of any help. My big brother is the type of person who's supposed to be on the battlefield. For me, it's just a waste of energy. It's pointless. Everyone's cut out for something different. The right person for the right task, you know? Please, Professor? Keep me off the battlefield, and maybe I won't tell everyone you were daydreaming!_Hilda: Hey, Professor! There are a lot of hardworking people here at the academy, huh? Everyone focuses on training without even needing to be told. Maybe they think, \"I must protect my friends, even if I have to risk my neck!\"\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're not diligent enough.\nChoice 2: You won't protect your friends?\nHilda:\nChoice 1 response: What?! I'm diligent! Everyone else is just... excessively diligent.\nChoice 2 response: Of course I'll try to protect them, but...\nHilda: I don't understand why anyone would want to risk their life for someone else. Why you die, no matter how you died, it's over. To me, it's more important to enjoy life. We only live once, after all. It's a waste to spend all your time working and being responsible, right?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No.\nChoice 2: I'm not sure.\nHilda: Well, no matter what people may think, I'm going to keep being me. So, in our next battle, I'll support everyone from the sidelines!\n(Byleth shakes his head)\n\nHilda: Aw, come on! Please? How about I do something for you, as a way of saying thanks? Oh, I know! I'll let you join me for dinner in the city! Everyone would be jealous, you know. They'd all love to spend time with me. OK, OK! Just think on it._Hilda: Professor, I asked to be on the sidelines! Why'd you put me on the battlefield? You did protect me, so I guess I can't complain... Wait a second — you're hurt! Did that happen when you were defending me?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Yes.\nChoice 2: No.\nHilda:\nChoice 1 response: I thought so.\nChoice 2 response: You're lying.\nHilda: How could you be so reckless?! Perhaps you'll say that that's what friends do. They look out for each other, and save each other. But if I saw you getting attacked, I wouldn't risk my neck to save you.\nByleth: Yes, you would.\nHilda: No! Don't overestimate me. I don't know if I've told you this, Professor. I have a very impressive big brother. I'm not just saying that. He's strong, smart, nice. He's basically perfect. Before Claude turned up, people talked about him becoming the next leader of the Alliance.\n(If Lorenz is recruited) Don't mention that to Lorenz, by the way. He never shuts up about that kind of thing.\nHilda: Anyway, my parents have high expectations for my brother, and he almost always meets them. No one expects anything of me. If something's even a little bit difficult, I find someone else to do it for me. That's what I've done my whole life.\nByleth: Are you scared of disappointing people?\nHilda: Of course! I can't stand the idea of not meeting someone's expectations. I know how people react when that happens. From watching my brother, I mean. People force their expectations on you, and then if you fail they look so... disappointed. Whenever that happens to my poor brother, he looks just devastated. So don't expect anything of me, please. That way, I can't disappoint you!\nByleth: I won't expect anything, but I believe in you.\nHilda: You're stubborn! OK, fine. Keep believing in me. I do want to support you and support my friends... I just don't want to let you down._null_null_Hilda: Hey, Professor! What are you doing, daydreaming in a place like this? I was doing the same thing, but still! I've been thinking, Professor... I worked hard to make it this far. All I wanted was to enjoy life, but so much for that! I had to go and become diligent. And it's entirely your fault.\nByleth: It is?\nHilda: Yes! You believed in me even when I told you not to! When I failed, you encouraged me. You kept looking out for me. Being treated like that, well... it made me want to try harder. I've gone to such lengths for you, you know! Gah, what a pain.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You've done well.\nChoice 2: Thank you.\nHilda: Hah! Does that mean I'm off the hook now? I guess it doesn't matter, because peace is here! No more hard work! Let's celebrate!\nByleth: Not so fast...\nHilda: Aw, what? I thought the fighting was over.\n(Byleth presents Jeralt's ring to Hilda)\n\nHilda: Does this mean...what I think it means?\n(Byleth nods)\n\nHilda: Wow! I... If I accept, we'll be depending on each other for the rest of our lives. Your life's gonna be hard! You want to lay that burden on me too? Here I thought I was free as a bird again... Don't you think this is a bit much? You're doing it again. Overestimating me. And yet, I have no choice but to accept. It's all your fault again, this time for making me fall in love with you. I do have one condition, however. Don't go thinking you can keep expecting things from me! A girl's gotta draw a line in the sand somewhere. From now on, I'm only gonna do the things I want to do! So... Say, if I want to support you for the rest of our lives, I'll go ahead and do that. And I'll do the best I can. As for you, you had better keep taking care of me too. Got it?\nHilda: Well then, now that all of that is settled... I happily accept! Thank you for watching over me, and believing in me. Let's keep doing that for each other for the rest of our lives!

22_29_Hilda: Ah, Lorenz. At it again.\nLorenz: Hello, Hilda. Are you training too? If that's the case, I may have to revise my opinion of you. Increased strength and skill would serve as perfect complements to your beauty and esteemed lineage.\nHilda: Um, no. I just left something here. I don't share your tireless work ethic. You're quite something. I don't think I've ever seen you take a break.\nLorenz: When the fate of all the Alliance rests on your shoulders, the rigors of training seem paltry by comparison! Besides, when my admirers see that even an individual of my talent possesses a diligent work ethic, it is sure to inspire them.\nHilda: I see. But I was wondering... Ah, never mind. You're clearly busy.\nLorenz: Oh! Is there something you require? What do you need? There is nothing I cannot handle!\nHilda: The trouble is I'm no good at fighting. I'm a fragile young lady, not a fearsome warrior. I didn't even want to join the academy, honestly. My brother made me.\nLorenz: Of course. For a delicate flower such as yourself, no doubt battle must present a terrible hardship.\nHilda: It does, it truly does. So I was wondering if, in the next training session, you'd do my fighting for me? I mean, I can put on a tough, \"I'm actually fighting\" kind of air, but... that's not quite enough on its own.\nLorenz: Please, leave all of the difficulty to me. I shall permit no harm to befall you!\nHilda: Ah, I'm so happy! In that case, I'll focus on giving a convincingly soldierly performance. You know, Lorenz, you're a good guy. Not that I'd have expected anything less from a noble.\nLorenz: With each of your foes that I vanquish, I shall only become ever stronger! Yes, leave it all to me!\nHilda: What a guy! And all I had to do was ask. Mm, maybe I'll have a snack._Lorenz: Ah! There's yet another option.\nHilda: Lorenz? What are you doing here?\nLorenz: Oh. Hello, Hilda. I'm using these pieces to represent soldiers on the battlefield. This will allow me to better visualize concepts of strategy.\nHilda: Very good. Is it fun?\nLorenz: It is utterly engrossing. Look—swap out certain pieces for others, and the board completely changes. Then, even considering the same types of units, employing different individuals calls for a new set of plans.\nHilda: Oh, I see! Or, I kinda see? It's hard for me to grasp really complex things like this.\nLorenz: Nonsense! It's thanks to your many requests that I have been adapting my fighting style as of late. Working to accommodate you has convincingly shown me how essential it is to rethink tactics on a continual basis. After all, the risk of getting hurt is greatly reduced if you are prepared for any situation. So now I will be ready for anything.\nHilda: …\nHilda: Lorenz, you're so wonderful, I'm at a loss for words. I'm not just saying that to flatter you either. Honestly!\nLorenz: Tell me something, Hilda. Did you make all of these ludicrous requests of me purely so that I might have the opportunity to develop myself? Because if so, I am deeply moved. Thank you for caring so thoughtfully and passionately for my personal growth.\nHilda: Um, you're welcome!\nLorenz: If you will permit me to return the favor, I do have one request to make of you. Will you hear me out?\nHilda: Ah, I'm not usually one for fielding requests, but I can make an exception in your case, I suppose.\nLorenz: I would be so pleased as to have the opportunity to observe you in action, in the heat of battle. Would you be so kind as to oblige me?\nHilda: Oh, very well... You've convinced me. But if it gets too intense... you'll help me out, right?_Hilda: Lorenz! Lorenz! Look!\nLorenz: What is it, Hilda? Ah, a letter. From your brother.\nHilda: That's right. Though part of me thinks it's some stranger imitating my brother's handwriting. He's never given me this much praise. \"Hilda, you've learned the value of persistence.\" \"You're really maturing.\" Stuff like that. Usually his letters are like, \"I'm worried about you,\" and, \"Stop being so lazy.\"\nLorenz: Since I have fought by your side, I can assure you that his praise is genuine and entirely deserved.\nHilda: I've written about fighting plenty of times in letters. Why's he so gushy this time around?\nLorenz: I would venture to guess that your depictions of battle are more passionate than before. It's no surprise that such authenticity would resonate with a veteran warrior like your brother.\nHilda: If that's true, I have you to thank. You've inspired me to throw myself into battle. Does everyone think I'm a tough warrior now? I don't want to be stuck with their high expectations.\nLorenz: Would that be so terrible? You are gifted, you know. Not to say that your lackadaisical nature has failed to endear itself to me.\nHilda: I choose to take that as a compliment.\nLorenz: Speaking of letters... did you keep your promise? Did you, uh, mention me?\nHilda: I did! I told my brother all about you. I said you were a uniquely gifted leader, who could inspire people to be their best selves. And I said that you'll be a real asset in this new era. I also told him how I wished you could join our family. He told me he'd be honored to call you his brother.\nLorenz: Truly?! To have such a valiant brother would be beyond my wildest expectations.\nHilda: Um—Lorenz. You do know what I mean about you joining our family, right?\nLorenz: I believe I do. And I confess, if I am correct, that the same thought has preoccupied me as well. But you must forgive me. Now is not the time. Before we consider our own future, we must first end this war. We must secure a peaceful world.\nHilda: And if we do attain a peaceful world, then what? Come on! Just say it.\nLorenz: As much as I'd like to grant that request, I cannot. This is something that will deeply affect our lives. It must be said at the proper time and place, with the most artfully chosen words, and the perfect offering. I am Lorenz Hellman Gloucester, after all!\n(Lorenz leaves the room)\n\nHilda: I'm not usually one for waiting around... But maybe I'll make an exception in his case._Hilda: Thank you, Lorenz! You've done so much for me. You've been a tremendous help.\nLorenz: It was but a trifle. Surely there was no small amount of danger, but in the interest of experience, I was happy to endure.\nHilda: You're so strong that I can't help but feel safe in your presence.\nLorenz: Yes, of course. Although no matter how much brute strength we bring to bear, it is important that there be a leader on the field as well. Without someone possessed of my sound judgment and adaptability, we would surely be lost.\nHilda: Surely, yes. My thoughts exactly. But, um...\nLorenz: Hm? What is it?\nHilda: I'm going to keep providing support from the back. You wouldn't mind doing more fighting for me, would you?\nLorenz: Oh. Well, uh... physically, I can certainly, but if you mean on an everyday basis...\nHilda: I knew you would! You have the generous soul of a true noble. I'll have to write back home and sing your praises!\nLorenz: Really? You mean to your father and brother?\nHilda: Oh yes. I have to write my big brother pretty often, as a matter of fact. He gets upset if I don't. And yet, I never have much to write about. I've been really straining for topics. That must strike you as a terrible nuisance—the idea of me blabbing about you in my letters.\nLorenz: Nuisance! Hardly! Your brother is one of the foremost commanders of the Alliance. I can think of no higher accolade than to have my name passed on to his noble ear.\nHilda: And I'll tell him about all your thrilling exploits! Although, if you can't help, that's OK too. I'll find something else to write about.\nLorenz: Oh, fear not! I shall show you exploits of a nature more thrilling than you could ever dream! Incidentally, when you write to him, please do not refer to me merely as Lorenz. Please use my full name... Lorenz Hellman Gloucester! This will be an excellent opportunity to advance the status of the Gloucester name!\nHilda: What a funny boy._C+_null_
22_35_Raphael: Right, this goes here.\nHilda: Hello, Raphael! What exactly are you doing with that piece of wood?\nRaphael: Hey, Hilda! I’m just doing this! Hyaaah!\nHilda: With your bare hands! Impressive that just the outer ring is left. It makes quite a nice circle.\nRaphael: Yeah! I just gotta polish it up and paint it, then the base of the necklace will be ready.\nHilda: Sorry, did you say “necklace”?\nRaphael: How’s it look? I bet it’s the right size too. And this tree bark smells amazing! Now I just need to carve these boar tusks to hang from it.\nHilda: Boar tusks?\nRaphael: I almost forgot! I was gonna add these wolf claws too. And I could even add some color to them...\nHilda: And wolf claws?!\nRaphael: Huh? Is something wrong, Hilda?\nHilda: That necklace! It has a certain, ah, rustic charm?\nRaphael: You’re right, it really does! Want me to make you one while I’m at it?\nHilda: Oh no! I wouldn’t want to trouble you. Besides, I think it would look better on you than me.\nRaphael: It would definitely look good on me, but this one’s actually a birthday present for my little sis.\nHilda: For your sister?! I mean, ah... Don't you think she might like something more feminine? Something cute!\nRaphael: Something cute? What’s wrong with something tough and rugged? This necklace is gonna have tusks and claws and stuff!\nHilda: But girls don’t usually go for tusks and claws and stuff. There should be flowers, or gems, or... Here, I can talk you through it. If you’re making a necklace for your sister... You might try putting a pretty little flower in a small crystal bottle, and sealing it with resin.\nRaphael: If you say so. But where would I find a flower that was pretty enough?\nHilda: Oh, honestly, I don’t know much about flowers. But, hm, now that I think about it... I remember hearing about a splendid flower that only blooms near Fódlan’s Throat.\nRaphael: Fódlan’s Throat? That’s on the eastern edge of the Alliance! I’d have to leave now if I’m going to make it back in time.\nHilda: Huh. Yeah, that does seem like a bit of a stretch. OK, let me think... Um, where’d he go? Well, no matter._Hilda: Who is it?\nRaphael: It's me! Raphael.\nHilda: Oh, Raphael! I'll get the door. What are you up to? Oh, whoa! What an enormous crate! And look what's in it. Crystal vials, shiny rocks...\nRaphael: And I got this too!\nHilda: Oh what a splendid flower, and so fresh! Hey, wait a second, is that for your sister?\nRaphael: Yeah, I finally got my hands on \"something cute,\" just like you suggested.\nHilda: That's so nice! But... wait a second. Is this that flower from Fódlan's Throat?\nRaphael: Of course! I had to run to make it back in time. It was a lot farther than I thought!\nHilda: You ran all that way? And while we're on the topic, aren't those Almyran crystals? Such fine carvings on them. They much be the work of a true artisan. It couldn't have been easy getting your hands on these.\nRaphael: I figured I should follow your advice! You know more about what's stylish than I ever could.\nHilda: Well done. I'm sure your sister will be pleased. All that's left is to make that necklace!\nRaphael: Yeah, about that... I don't know how to put it together. I spent so long the flowers have started wilting. There are only a few nice ones left.\nHilda: Huh. That's not good. I could try telling you how to make it, but you can't afford to lose any more flowers. Oh, all right. Looks like it's Hilda to the rescue! I'll take it from here.\nRaphael: Seriously?! You're really gonna help me?\nHilda: Sure! I make myself things from time to time. And this is definitely easier than teaching you how. But you owe me for this! I expect to be paid back.\nRaphael: Don't you worry about that! I'll find something really nice to pay you back with.\nHilda: It couldn't have been easy finding all these trinkets. He must really love his sister. Still, older brothers can be so dense._Hilda: Hey Raphael! I finally finished that necklace for you. Here you go.\nRaphael: Huh. Oh! Whoa! This is incredible! And so shiny! You're like an artist, Hilda! How'd you do this?\nHilda: Just like I told you. I put the flowers and the shiny rocks in a bottle, then poured in some resin to preserve everything. I thought the flowers you had were looking a little pathetic, so I added a few of my own. It was hard work, making sure the flowers and the stones were spread evenly, getting rid of the air bubbles...\nRaphael: What's this? The part you hang around your neck? I thought you'd use the one I gave you...\nHilda: Oh, yeah, no. That's a cord I braided. I was going to use metal, but some people are allergic to metal, so I figured, better safe than sorry. Anyway, you didn't give me much to work with, and look what I pulled off! I'm a miracle worker.\nRaphael: It's gorgeous! Beautiful! I've never seen anything like it! Thank you, Hilda! (Raphael begins sobbing)\nHilda: Whoa, hold up! What's with the blubbering?\nRaphael: (still crying) It's just... I bet my sister never got anything so pretty in her whole life! She's had to deal with so much because of me! I never got her anything this nice and cute before! She's gonna love it... and be so happy...\nHilda: Ah, um, OK. Yes, OK, that's enough. Come on, you're embarrassing me here... If you're really that happy, I'm glad I put some effort into something. For once.\nRaphael: Don't— Don't you always put effort into things?\nHilda: Hah! That's sweet of you, but no. I don't want to put in effort and then disappoint people. It's dispiriting, not to mention tiring.\nRaphael: But what if they're not disappointed? Then they feel great, and you feel great too!\nHilda: Yeah, you have a point there. I guess I'm realizing that now. You know, thanks to you, I'm starting to see things from my brother's perspective.\nRaphael: What do you mean? Do you have a big bro too?\nHilda: I do. I've always thought of him as an overprotective nuisance, but now I feel thankful. Looking at you, I couldn't help but think, \"Eh, sometimes big brothers are OK.\"\nRaphael: I didn't do anything special, though. It's natural for a big bro to look after his little sis. Oh! That reminds me! I still haven't found anything special enough to repay you for the necklace. I got an idea though. How about I help you make a tough looking necklace for your big bro?\nHilda: No need. I have a better idea. When the war's simmered down, why don't you and your sister come visit me?\nRaphael: Really? That's it?\nHilda: Yeah. I want to make sure it suits her, and then I can adjust the cord, if I need to.\nRaphael: Of course we'll come and visit! I told my sis all about you and she already wants to meet ya!\nHilda: Well, good. I look forward to it. In the meantime, hold me close to your heart.\nRaphael: Uh... What?\nHilda: That's what the necklace would say, if it could talk! \"Hold me close to your heart.\"_null_null_null_
22_24_(Ignatz approaches Hilda, who is talking to a student)\n\nIgnatz: …\n(Ignatz leaves)\n\nHilda: Hm?\n(scene transition)\n\nHilda: Hey, Ignatz! Ready to start cleaning?\nIgnatz: No, that's all right. Actually, I'm just finishing up.\nHilda: Oh! It's true! Look how tidy everything is! You've done such a marvelous job. I'm glad I didn't get in your way!\nIgnatz: Thank you very much. So, anyway, you can go now.\nHilda: Hm?\nIgnatz: You were talking to your friend, right? I just have some things to put away. It's OK, I can manage without you.\nHilda: Oh, Ignatz. I thought I saw someone earlier. That was you, wasn't it? You know, I'd have been willing to help. You could have just said, \"Hey, let's go and clean.\"\nIgnatz: It's all right, you were having a conversation. I didn't want to sneak up like I was eavesdropping. And really, I didn't need help.\nHilda: Aw, Ignatz, you darling! You're so considerate. Thank you so very much.\nIgnatz: Glad to be of service. I'll start putting all this away.\nHilda: Not so fast!\nIgnatz: Wh-what's the matter?\nHilda: Aren't you overdoing it? Don't you think you might be taking on too much, hm?\nIgnatz: Oh, uh, I didn't expect to hear that from you.\nHilda: Let me give you some advice. It's true I like to delegate as many tasks as I possibly can. But when someone helps me, I make sure to lavish them with praise as a reward for their hard work. So, then we come out even.\nHilda: On the other hand, look what almost happened just now. You did all that work for me, and I almost missed it! Now, where would that leave you? With no praise, no thanks! You'd be losing out.\nIgnatz: Um... Personally, I'd prefer to lose out, rather than inconvenience someone else. For instance, I'd have felt terrible for intruding on your important conversation earlier. Consider the negligible loss to me, versus the major inconvenience to you. Personal loss is always going to be the better choice, right?\nHilda: Huh. Well, if that's how you feel, then I'm not sure how to convince you otherwise._Hilda: Ugh, where is it? Oh. Hello there, Ignatz.\nIgnatz: Yes, hello, Hilda. What's the matter?\nHilda: Oh, it's just that I'm looking for a book. I can't seem to find it anywhere. I think it might be on one of the high shelves. Could you give me a hand?\nIgnatz: Ah, um, I'm really sorry, but actually...\nHilda: Hm?\nIgnatz: Some people got hurt while training in magic. I'm rushing to grab medical supplies.\nHilda: Whoa, that sounds serious. Don't let me stop you, in that case.\nIgnatz: Thanks. I'll be right back. (Ignatz leaves, then returns after a scene transition.)\nIgnatz: Sorry to keep you waiting. Now, what was the book you were looking for?\nHilda: Is everyone OK?\nIgnatz: Yes, it turned out to just be some scrapes and bruises. Oh, is that the book?\nHilda: Yes, I went and grabbed a ladder. That made the book much easier to find.\nIgnatz: Huh. You could have just asked someone else for their help.\nHilda: Well, you said people were hurt, so I just figured everyone had more important things to do. Honestly, I don't love heights. It was a bit scary up there, but... here we are! I managed.\nIgnatz: I see. Well, I'm sorry I couldn't help.\nHilda: Why are you apologizing, silly? Surely first aid is more important!\nIgnatz: I thought you might wait for me to come back, that's all.\nHilda: Oh, but giving first aid, that's not an easy job! I figured you'd be worn out. The last thing I want is to push you too hard.\nIgnatz: That's thoughtful of you, Hilda. Thanks for watching out for me.\nHilda: Oh, don't mention it! Do my cleaning again and we'll call it even. You did such a lovely job last time. The floor was practically sparkling. I swear, the air even tasted cleaner!\nIgnatz: I'm glad you liked it! You're really good at giving compliments, you know that? I suppose that's why everyone's so eager to help you with things.\nHilda: Exactly! By heaping praise on people, they're more eager to help me in the future. Oh, but that's not what's happening here. I was really, truly impressed by your cleaning skills.\nIgnatz: I wish I had everything figured out like you._(sound of glass breaking)\n\nHilda: Oof, capsized the teapot. Tea leaves on the carpet. This'll be fun to clean up.\nIgnatz: Hey, Hilda. Is something wrong?\nHilda: Ah, Ignatz. I accidentally knocked over my teapot. I'd drunk all the tea already, thank the goddess, but the tea leaves went right into the carpet.\nIgnatz: Oh, that's a mess. Here, let me help. That can leave stains if you're not careful.\nHilda: But don't you have somewhere to be?\nIgnatz: Oh, no, don't worry. I'm on a break.\nHilda: What's that in your hands? Oh, painting supplies. You were gonna do some painting, weren't you?\nIgnatz: Ah, yes. The weather's quite splendid, and I found a place where some gorgeous flowers are blooming. But the flowers aren't going anywhere this second. Let's clean this up!\nHilda: OK...\n(scene transition)\n\nHilda: Thanks, Ignatz. And sorry to keep you away from your painting.\nIgnatz: That's OK. It didn't stain, at least! We picked all the leaves out of the carpet.\nHilda: Still going painting? Or is it too late in the day?\nIgnatz: No, I think time-wise it'll be fine... If you're not doing anything, Hilda, would you care to join me?\nHilda: …\nIgnatz: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Forget what I said. I'm sure you're busy anyway.\nHilda: You didn't let me say anything.\nIgnatz: Well, no, but you didn't reply, so I thought you didn't want to.\nHilda: I never said I didn't want to. I was just surprised. I'd love to see those pretty flowers you mentioned. I'm glad you invited me.\nIgnatz: Whew, that's good! Wait, you're... you're glad?\nHilda: Of course I am! I like being invited to things, silly.\nIgnatz: Right, right, of course. It's affirming.\nHilda: Yeah, exactly. See? You get it. So there's no need to worry that an invitation is burdening someone. It feels good to be asked.\nIgnatz: Of course, of course. Well then. In addition to seeing the flowers with me, would you like to help with my painting?\nHilda: I wouldn't want to screw up your opus. I'm not much of a painter.\nIgnatz: No, I meant that I'd like to paint you, with the flowers all around you... Oh, that's too much, isn't it? Forget I said anything!\nHilda: Silly, you didn't even let me answer. But you're right, I'm not up for that.\nIgnatz: I'm sorry, I—\nHilda: I'm not up for that, unless your painting of me will look really, really cute. Can you make that happen?\nIgnatz: Huh? Yes, of course! I'll paint you cute as a button!\nHilda: Good! Shouldn't be too hard. I can feel a very cute smile coming on! (giggles)_null_null_null_
22_30_(Hilda is talking to a knight)\n\nHilda: Aw, are you sure? Thank you so much! You're always so kind to me. I'll have to repay you sometime.\nLysithea: Ahem...\n(scene transition)\n\nLysithea: Hm?\n(Hilda enters)\n\nHilda: Um, Lysithea? What are you doing there? Don't tell me you were listening just now, and judging me getting other people to do my work for me?!\nLysithea: I've got better things to do. Although I do wonder why everyone is always so eager to help you.\nHilda: I only ask for help if they offer! I don't ever pressure people.\nLysithea: So I've noticed. That's what strikes me as odd.\nHilda: I suppose they're just so taken with me, they want to help me out.\nLysithea: I see... That would explain it.\nHilda: Oh dear. I was expecting you to argue, not to agree with me right away.\nLysithea: There's no reason to deny what's clearly true. Everything about your outward appearance is immaculate and well thought out. Even your fingernails are always well-kept and painted—no doubt your toenails are the same.\nHilda: I can't tell if you're complimenting me or accusing me of something.\nLysithea: And you smell delightful. Like...candy. Or wait — Am I catching a hint of floral?\nHilda: I'm so glad you noticed! It's oil extracted from a flower that only blooms at night.\nLysithea: Floral oils, huh? I didn't think they had much use outside of homeopathy and house cleaning...\nHilda: I have some right here, actually. Here, I can give you a splash!\n(screen briefly fades to black)\n\nHilda: There we go! I put it on your wrists, so you'll want to rub them together. Body heat is what activates the scent. Your wrists and your neck are relatively warm, so they're good spots to apply the fragrance. For a very subtle fragrance, you can also try putting it under your clothing.\nLysithea: …\nHilda: So, what do you think?\nLysithea: Mmm. It's lovely. Now I smell just like you, Hilda.\nHilda: …\nLysithea: Somehow this makes me feel a little more...mature. Thank you.\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nHilda: So, that's it! She just wants to feel more grown-up. She's hard to read, that one... That smile, though! Who knew she could be so cute?_Hilda: Ah, found you! Hello, Lysithea.\nLysithea: Uhh, Hilda? What's that box you're holding… It's...making me nervous for some reason.\nHilda: (giggles) Your big sister Hilda's here, and she's going to make you look all grown-up!\nLysithea: I, uh, don't recall ever asking you to—\nHilda: That's right, I knew exactly what you needed! You didn't have to ask. Now, take a seat!\n(screen fades to black)\n\nHilda: With makeup, you can't just pick your favorite colors. You must choose colors that suit you and the occasion. If you'll be up close and personal—if you're going to a ball, for example—you want to keep it subtle. On the other hand, if you're going to be onstage, the colors should be overt.\nLysithea: Uh... I've never used makeup before. It sounds...complicated.\nHilda: Let's put up your hair to show off your neck. But we'll leave a few strands hanging, to make you look more vulnerable.\nLysithea: Why would I want to appear vulnerable? I don't want to be attacked!\nHilda: (giggles) This is for wooing, not warring. When you're older, you might understand the importance of looking a little vulnerable.\nLysithea: Ugh. You're treating me like a child... But I guess it's mostly harmless.\nHilda: Now, when you're standing, put your non-dominant foot a step back. It looks more elegant. When sitting, don't lean back, but don't slouch, either. And ensure at all times, you're gracefully extending your fingers.\nLysithea: Gracefully... extending... Argh. Suddenly standing and sitting are an exhausting activity!\n(screen fades in)\n\nLysithea: Hilda, that's enough. This is wearing me out.\nHilda: I knew you had potential! You'll go far, my darling. A couple of years to develop your charms, and no girl will outmatch you!\nLysithea: I'm not sure I'm cut out for this type of thing.\nHilda: Oh, believe me, you are. With a little help from me, you'll have men falling at your feet!\nLysithea: No, thanks. You're more suited to such things. I'll leave it to you. I haven't the time or the energy to fuss over how I'm perceived. Even with my best efforts, I'll never be as good at this as you are. Still, this was rather fun. Thank you, Hilda.\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nHilda: She really is brimming with untapped potential. When she smiles like that, wow! Even my heart skips a beat._null_null_null_null_
22_32_Hilda: Why do I have to clean the library?\nMarianne: …\nHilda: “It looks like you’re not busy.” I was quite busy sampling pastries, I’ll have you know!\nMarianne: …\nHilda: Who wants to sort books, anyway? They’re so bulky and heavy, it takes forever to lug them around!\nMarianne: …\nHilda: Right, Marianne? You agree with me, right?\nMarianne: N-no, I don’t mind it.\nHilda: Oh, you like cleaning, then? I will say, you look like someone who’d be good at it.\nMarianne: I, umm, well...\nHilda: In that case, it’s all yours! I’d only slow you down, if I’m being honest. As I always say, “If you want something done right, let someone else do it themselves.”\nMarianne: Um.\nHilda: Right, I’m off to run some errands. I’ll leave all this in your capable hands!\nMarianne: …\n(scene transition)\n\nHilda: Hey, Marianne, are you... Whoa. What happened? This place looks even worse than before! I didn’t even realize that was possible.\nMarianne: I’m sorry, Hilda. I just didn’t know the best way to organize the books while sorting.\nHilda: Oh. well, no way around it, I suppose. I’ll show you how it’s done. First, you have to decide where you’ll put each topic. Then, all of the books that don’t match that topic, remove them from the section. When you remove them, you need a temporary place to put them. Let’s put books on magic, here, books on swordsmanship, here. Once you’ve done that, you just put the books back in their sections. Like so.\nMarianne: Wow, Hilda! That was incredible!\nHilda: Yeah, yeah, what kind of praise. Looks like in the end, I’m doing this whole thing on my own, hm?\nMarianne: Sorry. The least I can do is help you put them back on the shelf._Hilda: You've been an enormous help! Thanks so much!\nMarianne: E-excuse me. I have some more supplies that just arrived for the infirmary.\nHilda: Oh, there were more? I thought I'd gotten them all.\nMarianne: I just have bandages and other small things, but there might be more coming.\nHilda: Well, I just got the boys to bring in the heavy bottles. Looks like we can't fit all of it without some rearranging though. You know, if you'd arrived earlier, you could have helped me tidy up.\nMarianne: My apologies.\nHilda: I don't really need your apologies. I need your help.\nMarianne: Oh, OK. How can I help?\nHilda: How can you help? I said \"tidy up,\" didn't I? See the shelves there? See if you can clear out some space and tuck away the bandages.\nMarianne: I can try... Ah!\nHilda: Hey! Careful, Marianne. There's some strong stuff in those bottles.\nMarianne: I'm sorry. I—\nHilda: No, look, just leave the bandages for now, and move the bottles from the shelf.\nMarianne: I can do that. Ah! Now the bandages fell!\nHilda: Aaagh! No! So, in the end, I did it all by myself.\nMarianne: I'm sorry that I was no help. I just got in your way.\nHilda: It's fine. We'll even it out with pastries.\nMarianne: You want me to get you pastries? I guess I can.\nHilda: You seem so thoughtful and composed, but you're surprisingly clumsy. It's such an odd mix, I practically have no choice but to take over for you.\nMarianne: You're right... I'm sorry._Marianne: Um. Hilda? I wanted to thank you for helping me in the infirmary. I brought you these pastries...\nHilda: Ooh, thanks! I'll put some tea on. Have a seat.\nMarianne: That sounds lovely, but... I also wanted to apologize for always causing you so much trouble.\nHilda: It's no trouble, no trouble at all. Everything tastes better with friends, don't you think? I give you help, you give me sweets, we have a little tea party... It's a good arrangement, I'd say. I'm used to it now, so if it changed suddenly, I would feel a little disoriented.\nMarianne: I suppose if you're enjoying yourself, then it can't be that bad.\nHilda: Sure. You don't seem to mind listening while I gab, so I'm enjoying myself plenty! But do let me know if I'm too boring.\nMarianne: No, no. You're not boring at all. In fact, you're, um, very good at talking. You're also good with your hands. You can clean and organize better than almost anyone. I envy you...\nHilda: Oh stop, I'm blushing! I'm not as great as all that. We're both a lot different on the inside than we look on the outside. Don't you think?\nMarianne: How do you mean?\nHilda: People who see you think you're so proper, but you're actually clumsy? That's why I help you. Because there are some things you just can't do.\nMarianne: I'm sorry you always have to clean up after me...\nHilda: I didn't say I hated it. In fact, you've taught me a few new techniques I can use to persuade people. Maybe I'll start imitating you a little bit. I'll do the Marianne. That sheepish \"sorry,\" and those quavering downcast eyes... But that might not work as well for me. People would probably assume that I'd hit my head.\nMarianne: Oh, well...\nHilda: Aw! Marianne, laughing at me! So rude, and yet, so adorable.\nMarianne: I'm so sorry. I just can't help it. When I imagine you doing those things, I—\nHilda: Yeah, yeah. It's rather un-Hilda-like, I'll admit... Ahem. OK. That's enough laughing.\nMarianne: Hahaha! I'm so—haha!—so-sor-sor—\nHilda: Hey, are you all right? That tea's hot, Marianne! Be careful!\nMarianne: Ah, yes. Ouch! Hot!\nHilda: Come on! What did I just say?!\nMarianne: I know. I'm sor—owowow! Hot!\nHilda: Oh boy. A real steady hand, that Marianne. It's nice to see her laugh... Sure, she was laughing at me. But how can I get mad when she looks so dang cute?_null_null_null_
22_27_Hilda: Why do I have to organize the library? I’ll get in trouble if it’s not done, and I can’t think of anyone that would do it for me. Hm...since no one else is around though... Time for a little break. What are those sounds?\nLeonie: Ha! Yah!\nHilda: Leonie, always at it. How exhausting that must be. Hm, what’s this?\nLeonie: Hey, what are you doing? That’s mine!\nHilda: If you leave it lying on the ground, people will think it’s trash.\nLeonie: I usually wear it around my neck, but I put it down while I’m training so I don’t get sweat all over it.\nHilda: Well, people wont know that, will they? You should have just left it in your room.\nLeonie: It’s a good luck charm. If I don’t keep it close by, then what’s the point?\nHilda: How stubborn of you. I will say, it looks to be a very well-loved charm.\nLeonie: Captain Jeralt gave it to me when I was a kid.\nHilda: If it’s that important to you, you should wash it. Then again, I suppose it is made of wood. Have you considered coating it with resin? That would persevere it nicely. You could even accessorize it. Make it look cute!\nLeonie: Thanks, but Captain Jeralt made it especially for me. I’d really rather keep it just as it is.\nHilda: Well, if that’s how you feel, I wont argue with you. Me, personally, I’d choose a cute necklace over a dirty old charm any day!\nLeonie: I’m sure you would. But Captain Jeralt didn’t treat me as some young girl. He treated me like a person who mattered. An equal. He taught me everything. I don’t want to forget his teachings, so I’m going to keep this charm just the way it is.\nHilda: Huh... What do you know?_Leonie: Hey, Hilda. You said you wanted to talk? Whoa, what’s with all these expensive necklaces? Why do you have them all laid out like that?\nHilda: Pretty, right? I’ll let you choose which you like.\nLeonie: Huh? Why would you do that?\nHilda: Just choose! I want you to have one.\nLeonie: I’m not gonna accept a gift like that without a reason. Even with a reason, I’d probably decline.\nHilda: Look how gorgeous they are though! Wearing beautiful things gives you energy.\nLeonie: Maybe for you.\nHilda: Yes, for me. Why would it be any different for you?\nLeonie: Because to me, those are just fancy decorations. Take this one for example. How did you come by it?\nHilda: This was the first necklace I picked out for myself. It doesn’t suit my style nowadays, so I don’t often wear it.\nLeonie: That’s the kind of thing I’m talking about. The sentimental value of each one. These necklaces are nice and all, but I don’t have any special feelings or memories about any of them. But this charm, it’s packed with things I don’t want to forget. Captain Jeralt's teachings, and a lot of memories too. Even if to you, it’s just a dirty hunk of wood.\nHilda: Hm... I do understand. But, still. You’re not going to be very popular with the boys if you keep wearing that dirty old thing!\nLeonie: Like I care about that.\nHilda: You can drop the whole stony-faced act. Come on, I’m offering to help you here. I could even make a charm for you, as a gift, if you’re really hung up on “sentimental value.”\nLeonie: Make a charm for me? You’d do that?\nHilda: Sure! Why not? I don’t want you to be alone your whole life. Besides, this happens to be a talent of mine. It’ll be really, really cute so you’d better wear it!\nLeonie: Sure! I can’t just accept a gift for nothing though. I’ll make one for you too, if you’ll teach me how! And I’ll put plenty of feeling into it, so when we exchange them, it’ll really mean something.\nHilda: Oh, that sounds lovely! I’ll gladly teach you how. But make me something cute, OK?\nLeonie: I’ll...see what I can do._null_null_null_null_
22_39_Sylvain: Hey there, Hilda! You're looking cute today.\nHilda: Thanks! You're looking quite handsome yourself.\nSylvain: You know exactly how to talk to a guy. I like it.\nSylvain: What's with all the books?\nHilda: Oh, these? I was just bringing them to...\nHilda: Ah, ouch. Ouch!\nSylvain: What's wrong? Did you hurt your foot?\nHilda: Yeah...I tripped earlier.\nHilda: But I'm supposed to return these books to the library by the end of the day!\nSylvain: Relax. I'm sure there's a handsome guy around here who knows how to carry books to the library.\nSylvain: You rest your foot. I'll take care of this.\nHilda: Oh, no. That's all right. You must have something more important to do.\nSylvain: Nothing is more important than helping you. Just pile the books on that desk, and I'll get 'em where they're going.\nHilda: Aw, you're so kind! Thank you so, so much!\nSylvain: It's nothing. I'm happy to—Wow. That is a lot of books.\nHilda: I'll just leave them right there for your. Thanks again, Sylvain! You're the best.\n(Hilda leaves)\n\nSylvain: Wait a minute. Some of these books have dust on them. She's been holding on to these for months!\nSylvain: The professor was looking for this one a few weeks ago! Hilda…\nSylvain: Hang on! Did she just trick me into doing something she didn't want to do?_Sylvain: Hilda! Lovely as ever. I swear when you're around the sun shines brighter and everything sparkles.\nHilda: Sylvain! You're looking superb, as always.\nSylvain: Thank you. Are you going out today? If you do, then be careful. I'd hate to think you might hurt your foot again.\nHilda: My foot? Oh, yes! You mean that time you helped with the books. No need to worry. The foot's fine now, even better than it was before.\nSylvain: I noticed, you know, since I'm always looking at cute girls and you are one of the cuter ones... Your foot was better during the battle. You were running all over, just a regular warrior princess! And less than a day after such a terrible injury...\nHilda: My friends were depending on me, so I just had to fight through the pain.\nSylvain: Hilda, please don't lie to me. I knew your foot wasn't really hurt, but I returned your books anyway. Take it from a guy who does his fair share of pretending to be someone he's not...and I say this as a friend...You are a terrible liar. And those books you left in your room for so long? Teachers and classmates needed those. So stop lying, and maybe stop being quite as selfish too.\nHilda: Huh. You saw right through me. Honestly, I'd completely forgotten that I still had those books. I really was going to return them. Did the librarian say anything to you?\nSylvain: Oh yeah. I got an earful of yelling and accusations meant for you.\nHilda: Huh? Didn't you just say it was my fault?\nSylvain: Nah. I figured the librarian would feel better if they just let loose. No reason to make them wait for you.\nHilda: I'm so sorry. You got a tongue-lashing that should've been directed at me.\nSylvain: Tell you what. All will be forgiven if you promise three things—stop lying, take responsibility, and fall madly in love with me.\nHilda: Aw, Sylvain. I do love you, you know? I just...wouldn't want you for a husband.\nSylvain: What? Why not?\nHilda: Well, not to offend you, but I can't help but feel that your niceness is somehow...shallow. My brother would probably cut you into pieces the moment he saw your face.\nSylvain: Your brother sounds...terrifying, actually.\nHilda: We're losing the thread a bit here. Evidently, you can see through my act, so I'll just be straightforward about taking advantage of you.\nSylvain: Ha! Well, I'll take what I can get. Just don't go causing troubles for guys who aren't me.\nHilda: It's a deal. Good-bye for now, Sylvain._null_null_null_null_
22_33_Mercedes: Goodness, Hilda. You look worried. Is something the matter?\nHilda: Oh, Mercedes! I was on my way to the greenhouse, to water the flowers. But I have a meeting with the professor right now, so I'll have to be quick.\nMercedes: It must be urgent to call you at this hour of the morning! Go see what the professor needs from you. I can take care of the flowers.\nHilda: Oh, are you sure? Thank you so much!\nMercedes: It's no problem at all! Let me take the water from you.\nHilda: Thank you again! I'll see you at lunch.\nMercedes: Right! I'm off!\nHilda: Oops, my meeting with the professor was tomorrow. Anyways, thanks Mercedes!\n(Mercedes goes off screen)\n\nHilda: Still no Mercedes. All she had to do was water a few plants. I didn't think it would take this much time. It's almost noon. Maybe I'll go see what she's up to.\n(Hilda enters the greenhouse)\n\nMercedes: And that's the last of that! Perfect!\nHilda: What's taking you so long?\nMercedes: Oh, Hilda! Is your meeting with the professor over already?\nHilda: Um, yes. It's almost lunchtime. What are you still doing here?\nMercedes: Lunchtime? I hadn't realized how late it was... After watering the flowers, I noticed that the greenhouse was in need of some tidying. I must have gotten a bit carried away. It's so pleasant working in here!\nHilda: Oh, \"pleasant,\" sure! You're such a kinda person.\nMercedes: No, no. It was my pleasure. Anyway, shall we head to the dining hall?\n(Mercedes goes off screen)\n\nHilda: I should have done it myself. Waiting for her was so exhausting...\nMercedes: What was that, Hilda? Come along, I'm hungry!\nHilda: Uh, coming! What should we eat?_Mercedes: Good morning, Hilda. Is anything troubling you today?\nHilda: Nope. Nothing. If there was, I don't think I'd ask for your help.\nMercedes: I'm sorry to hear that. Have I done something to upset you?\nHilda: Not exactly. You go overboard helping me, is all. You do way, way too much. So I feel guilty, like I'm putting you out.\nMercedes: Goodness! It was never my intention to have you worry about me!\nHilda: Hm. Can I ask you something?\nMercedes: Of course. What is it?\nHilda: What are you doing today?\nMercedes: Following my morning prayers, I'll be cleaning the altar then caring for the flowers in the greenhouse. Then it's off to the library to help organize and sort, then to the dining hall to wipe down the tables and chairs. The floors could use a good polish too... Oh! And the weather's so nice that I might air out the bedding! After that it's—\nHilda: Wow, you're still not done? There's more?\nMercedes: Well, the dishcloths in the dining hall are all frayed, so I was hoping to mend them.\nHilda: Sewing! Don't you think that's too much?\nMercedes: Whatever do you mean? And why are you speaking so loudly all of a sudden?\nHilda: Ugh! I'll help with the dining hall. But I am not sewing.\nMercedes: You want to help? That would be delightful!\nHilda: Everyone asks you for help, and you always say yes, don't you?\nMercedes: I suppose. I believe it's important to help where you can. If you see someone in trouble, you can't leave them, can you?\nHilda: You're too kind, Mercedes—literally. I can't empathize.\nMercedes: I'm sure you can. You and I are very similar in that way.\nHilda: Are you serious? How? We have nothing in common.\nMercedes: That may be so, but you thought I was in trouble and you agreed to help, didn't you?\nHilda: Well, I mean, yes.\nMercedes: That's exactly what I do! I'm so happy to have found a kindred spirit!\nHilda: Uh... If that's what makes you happy, OK. Kindred spirits, let's go with that.\nMercedes: Now that I've got you at my side, I can take on even more responsibilities!\nHilda: Not a chance!_null_null_null_null_
22_37_Hilda: Oh, Seteth! Good day to you, and farewell!\nSeteth: Just a moment, Hilda. How are you feeling?\nHilda: Sorry? Oh, ah, fine. I'm doing just fine.\nSeteth: I am glad to hear it. I had heard that you requested a substitute for your cleaning duty, due to an illness.\nHilda: You really do know everything, Seteth.\nSeteth: Just prior to that, you also asked for someone to take your place with table-setting. I believe that was due to a wrist injury. It was not too serious, I hope?\nHilda: Ah, you heard about that. The wrist is all healed up, thank you.\nSeteth: I seem to recall also that you declined to participate in a mock battle. That was due to a headache, yes?\nHilda: I have a very fragile body, you see. It's so kind of everyone to make accommodations.\nSeteth: Indeed. It is a great friend who offers to help without complaint. See that you treasure such friends. And that you return the favor.\nHilda: Of course! Well then, I should really be...\nSeteth: By the way...\nHilda: Was there something else you wanted?\nSeteth: It so happens I am on my way to the chapel to offer my prayers. Would you care to join me?\nHilda: Oh, no...I wouldn't want to intrude! I've already offered up all my prayers for the day.\nSeteth: Marvelous. We must always remember to give our thanks to the goddess. It is essential that we offer our prayers to her each day. That we reflect on our deeds, and strive to live as she would want us to live. For the goddess sees all that we say and do.\nHilda: Oh! I...\nSeteth: Now, if you will excuse me.\nHilda: Of course! Good-bye, now... How is Seteth so scary? It feels like he can see right through me! I guess that's his way of saying, \"Stop being lazy.\" I wish he'd just scold me outright. This is precisely why I try to avoid him..._Hilda: Oh, it's Seteth! I'd better slip away before he—\nSeteth: Ah—I see you are indulging in a bit of reading. You are fond of books, I take it?\nHilda: Yes, reading's one of my favorite pastimes! I was just finishing up, actually, so I think I'll—\nSeteth: That is most fortuitous.\nHilda: Um, fortuitous? How do you figure?\nSeteth: Come with me. I have a story to share with you. Once upon a time, deep in the cold mountains, there lived a lazy fox and an industrious squirrel. The squirrel worked tirelessly, all day long, while the fox did nothing but lounge around and play. When autumn came, the squirrel hurriedly gathered up acorns for the winter. But the fox continued to play without a care. A biting winter fell upon the land. The mountains, caked in snow, concealed all nourishment from sight. The hungry fox went to the squirrel's dwelling, but the squirrel had locked up tight and gone to sleep. Every so often, the squirrel would wake, enjoy a nibble of an acorn, and then return to an easy slumber. The fox, on the other hand, with nowhere else to turn, was forced to scrounge for food in the bitter cold of the forest. Forlorn and hungry, he wandered in solitude all through the winter, until spring came once more. And so it is, to this very day, that foxes are denied the comforts of hibernation.\nHilda: Ah, I really learned something about foxes! Haha... I read lots of fairy tales like that when I was little. But the lazy fox and the industrious squirrel, huh? That one I don't think I've heard before.\nSeteth: That is not surprising, considering I wrote it.\nHilda: Oh! You wrote it?\nSeteth: I did. When Flayn was young, she loved fairy tales more than anything. I would read them to her often. This one, however, is a more recent creation. I wrote it for the benefit of the children in the monastery. So, what do you think? I'm curious to hear what sort of impression it made on you.\nHilda: It's so cute!\nSeteth: Y-you found it to be...cute?\nHilda: I can just see it now, you writing fairy tales for your little sister! That's just the cutest thing. Honestly, to me, you usually come across as stern and overly perceptive. But now I know you have a sweet side too! I feel like I'm seeing you in a whole new light.\nSeteth: That is...not what I was hoping to hear._Seteth: Hello, Hilda.\nHilda: Oh, Seteth! Good day!\nSeteth: Is it?\nHilda: I, uh... Did I do something wrong?\nSeteth: Not to my knowledge. But I cannot help but notice that you no longer shy away when I speak to you.\nHeheh...heh... You noticed that, huh? When you stare at me, I feel like you're peering into my soul.\nSeteth: And that no longer bothers you? Does that mean your conscience is finally clear?\nHilda: Nah, I got used to it. I know you're not scary.\nSeteth: That's unfortunate. You really should do something to correct your lazy behavior.\nHilda: Maybe that's true. I wouldn't want to be like the fox, forced to wander in the snow all winter.\nSeteth: I'm pleased to see you grasped the moral of the story.\nHilda: Don't you think the squirrel was a little cold-hearted though? He seems not to care about what happens to his friend, as long as he himself is happy.\nSeteth: You know, that is a valid point. I have no wish to encourage that attitude in children. Perhaps if the fox only survives thanks to the squirrel kindly sharing some of his acorns. How does that sound to you?\nHilda: I like it OK. I'm sure the kids will admire that nice, compassionate squirrel.\nSeteth: Thank you for your insight. As it happens, I have some other stories that I wrote for Flayn. Would you like to hear them?\nHilda: You should make a book out of them! It's a shame that only Flayn and I get to enjoy them.\nSeteth: What a fine idea! I will begin immediately. Though I feel such a book requires illustrations, and I have no artistic talent. Would you lend me a hand?\nHilda: Uh, I think Ignatz might be a better choice, but...I can probably manage. Not like they need to be terribly fancy.\nSeteth: I could use some more of your wisdom with regard to the content of the stories also.\nHilda: That sounds like a pain, but I'm invested in this now. Let's do it!\nSeteth: Excellent! That's wonderful to hear! Let us produce the very best book we can, for the children's sake!\nHilda: He looks so excited, I can't help but lend a hand._Seteth: Ah, Hilda. Business in town?\nHilda: Yes! I'm buying some art supplies.\nSeteth: Oh! To replenish what you used on our book, I presume? Allow me to compensate you.\nHilda: No, no need! I use them for my own crafting and accessory making too. By the way, your tales seem quite popular! I saw a big crowd of kids at the church.\nSeteth: Wonderful to hear! We made the right choice, leaving it there.\nHilda: I also heard a mother scolding her child by saying, \"If you keep lazing around, you'll turn into a fox!\" Though as long as there's a friendly squirrel around, being a fox doesn't sound so bad.\nSeteth: Hmm. That was not my intention. Perhaps the story was better off in its original form, after all.\nHilda: Anyway, I guess you've got something to keep you busy after the war.\nSeteth: Originally these stories were for Flayn, but now there are lots of people who love them.\nHilda: The kids are looking forward to your next release. You don't want to disappoint them.\nSeteth: I do wonder how appropriate it is to sit around and write children's books in an era of great change.\nHilda: \"An era of great change.\" Isn't that exactly when kids need something to hold onto? They're the future of Fódlan, after all!\nSeteth: Astute observation! But if I am to continue in this trade, I will require more of your assistance.\nHilda: Really? You're a successful author, and you still want to use my lousy illustrations?\nSeteth: I need an artist who can appreciate the message and who can draw pictures that resonate with children. Your art has a certain careless quality that I feel matches my work splendidly.\nHilda: A \"careless quality\"? That doesn't sound like a compliment.\nSeteth: Did you not purchase those art supplies today in the hopes of continuing with this work?\nHilda: Well, yes. I guess I can stick with it until the war is over.\nSeteth: Such lukewarm commitment—no matter. We can consider the post-war situation when we come to it.\nHilda: Hm. I'm pretty fond of being a fox, but becoming a squirrel wouldn't be the worst thing. I'll admit, I like seeing Seteth pour his heart into these stories...\nSeteth: What was that?\nHilda: Didn't say a word! Let's get to work on that sequel!_A+_null_
