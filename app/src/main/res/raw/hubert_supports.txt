23_41_(Location: Training Grounds)\n\nHubert: Hello, Professor. You seem to be in good health.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I am, yes. And yourself?\nChoice 2: Do you need something?\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: Of course.\nChoice 2 response: Indeed I do.\nHubert: Hm. Doesn't seem intimidated.\nByleth: Something wrong?\nHubert: No, not at all. It's just that I find myself a little concerned for your well-being. You see, Lady Edelgard has taken something of an interest in you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It seems so.\nChoice 2: I think not.\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: Don't be flippant.\nChoice 2 response: She has. And it's beneath you to be so glib.\nHubert: There is something you need to understand about the role I play here. One of my many duties is to determine potential advantages and potential threats to Her Highness. If you prove yourself useful to Lady Edelgard, then all will be well. If you pose a threat...I shall have to dispose of you.\nByleth: Dispose of me?\nHubert: Yes. This is no joke. While I may be a student here, I am her servant first and foremost. Therefore, if an untimely demise is not to your liking, you would do well to demonstrate your utility with all haste. I should warn you that I am far less compromising than Lady Edelgard. Do not be at ease merely because you stand in her good graces for the time being.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm not worried.\nChoice 2: I'm not sure about this.\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: Ha! Such confidence. I'm beginning to see why you caught her eye.\nChoice 2 response: Don't be coy. If I were you, I would take this more seriously. Your life is at stake.\nHubert: My family, House Vestra, has been sworn to House Hresvelg for generations. Since the dawn of the Empire, we have worked to protect the emperor by any means necessary—both in the open and in the shadows. If you incur our wrath, you will see just what I mean._(Byleth walking outside. Byleth stops suddenly.)\n\nByleth: ...\n(Byleth turns around)\n\nHubert: It seems I am discovered. I suppose that means assassination is out of the question. At least for now.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What do you think you're doing?\nChoice 2: Assassination?\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: Merely keeping an eye on you, for the moment. Nothing to be concerned over. Unusually watchful—difficult to steal upon in slumber. Perhaps an odorless, tasteless poison...\nChoice 2 response: Unusually watchful—difficult to steal upon in slumber. Perhaps an odorless, tasteless poison...\nHubert: Lady Edelgard certainly took interest in a difficult one this time.\nByleth: Why are you following me?\nHubert: I suppose that question does warrant a response, considering it may mean your life. The answer requires me to explain some of the complex internal politics of the Empire. Are you familiar with Volkhard von Arundel? He is Lady Edelgard's uncle. You may also know him as Lord Arundel, the Empire's Regent. Many years ago, he took Her Majesty and fled to the Kingdom of Faerghus. Then, after a time, he returned to seize power. Joining forces with Prime Minister Aegir and my father, Lord Arundel rendered Emperor Ionius IX...politically impotent. Lady Edelgard is Ionius IX's daughter. I cannot begin to fathom the depth of her sadness at his betrayal. I see something of Lord Arundel in you... When I look at you, I feel I can almost see a second self lurking beneath the surface. It is as if you are in constant dialogue with something inside your heart—something with desires very different from your own. Does that description feel familiar to you at all?\n(Byleth looks down)\n\nHubert: Because to me you seem unpredictable. As though you could turn traitor at any moment.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No, not familiar at all.\nChoice 2: There might be something to that.\nHubert: The more I learn about you, the less I like.\nHubert: I had thought you might be of some use to Lady Edelgard. But now I am beginning to think you may, through no fault of your own, present too great a risk. I hope you will prove me wrong, Professor. I would hate for this to come to bloodshed._Hubert: Nice place, isn't it, Professor? Standing here, you can almost feel the goddess's absence. Discounting what dwells within you, of course. Do you think some punishment would rain down from the sky if this monastery were to be destroyed? Of course not. Even if the so-called Immaculate One came back here for revenge... That would only be the result of this war, not the work of a deity.\nByleth: Do you hate the goddess?\nHubert: If it is between love and hate, then I would choose the latter. The goddess failed to properly govern this world. That is why it is necessary for Lady Edelgard to become the supreme leader of Fódlan. Those with power must use it wisely. Is that not a teaching of the Church of Seiros? It's absurd to preach to others what you cannot practice yourself.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sometimes it's necessary.\nChoice 2: You're absolutely right.\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: That is logical, but I am afraid your logic is informed by your humanity.\nChoice 2 response: Yes. It is our humanity that pushes us to step up and take the lead should the need arise.\nHubert: That is not the case for inhuman creatures with lifespans well beyond our own. We must fight to preserve what makes us human. You are the one closest to the enemy. I wonder if you will be able to maintain your humanity to the end.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Of course I will.\nChoice 2: If I'm unable to...\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: You make it sound easy. I find myself trusting you. Even with my life.\nChoice 2 response: Does that mean you know I will do what must be done? You must trust me a great deal.\nHubert: Heh. I've already dedicated my life to Lady Edelgard. To throw my lot in with you is inconceivable. But if I had two lives to give... I might devote one of them to you. Not as master and servant, but as equal partners._null_null_null_

The war may be over, but matters of the government, diplomacy, and justice remain to be dealt with. There is one problem in particular that must be sorted first, however.\nByleth: What problem is that?\nHubert: You. Rather... you and me. (laughs) To think, I had rehearsed a long preamble. Now, when it matters, it's all vanished from memory as suddenly as the morning dew. To the point, then. I... love you. In fact, I wish to marry you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You what?!\nChoice 2: Yes! Gladly!\nHubert:\nChoice 1 response: I know this must come as a surprise. Especially in light of my devotion to Lady Edelgard.\nChoice 2 response: Your candid sincerity is... overwhelming. You must have known all along that I had feelings for you.\nHubert: I've already spoken to Her Majesty about this. She told me to follow my heart. She seems to prefer that you be with me rather than some dubious individual. So, you could say that we have her blessing.\nByleth: Then, this is yours...\nHubert: Is that... a ring? You came here with the same idea?\n(Byleth nods)\n\nHubert: I cannot believe I'm saying this. I am truly happy.\nHubert: I am afraid you've outdone me. I've brought no such token. Not much of a suitor, am I? I've never done well with gifts or flattery. Protecting you is easy. But to be a good husband...\nByleth: No need to worry.\nHubert: Of course such a thing doesn't bother you. I hope I can support you with the same tenacity. Thank you for doing me this honor. (bows)\nHubert: I once thought that killing you would be a great challenge, but... The real difficulty was declaring my love.
23_28_Linhardt: Well, this is fascinating... Following this equation...\nHubert: Linhardt. Here again, I see.\nLinhardt: Go away, Hubert. Now is not a good time. Ah, yes. The double line becomes a helix, and its arc... No, that cannot be correct...\nHubert: Now is exactly the time. Lady Edelgard requests your presence. Come. The lecture is about to start.\nLinhardt: Politely inform her that my research is vastly more important than...whatever it is she has to say.\nHubert: While your passion may be admirable, it is sadly misdirected. This matter takes priority. Return to your hobby when your duty is done.\nLinhardt: Hobby? But this research will most certainly prove useful in the future!\nHubert: The Empire requires you to be useful now. I should think you would want the same. You have an almost unparalleled intellect. A singular focus. An unfettered imagination. In truth, you have talents that many, including myself, will never have the privilege of possessing.\nLinhardt: Are you complimenting me, Hubert? That alone deserves to be studied.\nHubert: Let me finish. I haven't an ounce of respect for the cause you have chosen to waste your talents on. Which changes frequently, I might add, with no rhyme, reason, or results. Learn to apply yourself to something constructive. You may still have a bright future.\nLinhardt: That sounds suspiciously as if you're not going to leave me alone. I just want to live a life doing things that interest me. Is that so wrong?\nHubert: That is unacceptable. Even for a nobleman. Her Highness will soon ascend the throne. She is attempting to deal with such noble privilege head on.\nLinhardt: You have a point, and I understand where you're coming from. But I can't do it. I can't bring myself to work for someone else.\nHubert: Pathetic. Keep to your books, then. Good-bye, Linhardt._Hubert: I can't believe it. How can I show my face to Lady Edelgard after this?\nLinhardt: That's what you get, Hubert. If you rested like me, you wouldn't collapse from exhaustion.\nHubert: As much as it pains me to say it, you're right. But to be looked after—ugh. By you, of all people. That might be the worst part of this. I don't know how to feel, to be honest. So for now, let's pretend I thanked you.\nLinhardt: Oh, come now. Even I wouldn't abandon someone who'd collapsed.\nHubert: You would have in a heartbeat if anyone else had been around.\nLinhardt: Ah, yes. Quite accurate, Hubert. Why would I ever bother to be a decent person if there were anyone else I could foist the duty upon? If your situation turned bad, it would have been an absolute hassle. I could never just leave you there.\nHubert: If that were the sort of man you truly were, we could never be friends.\nLinhardt: Heh, but if we weren't friends, I probably would have just left you.\nHubert: Shame you're so reluctant to do any real work. You're actually pretty good at this. Made sure I was comfortable. Checked carefully for injuries. Even carried me here yourself. If only you'd apply that knowledge of yours so proactively and thoroughly all the time... You'd be a tremendous asset to the Empire.\nLinhardt: There you go again. I see no problem with staying just the way I am. Think of it this way... In an anthill, 20 percent of the ants are asleep at any given time... And it's not because they're lazy—far from it. When the working ants become tired, they go to sleep, and the others wake up. That's me. I'm the ant who rests so I can work later when other people are tired.\nHubert: Maybe that's true. But even if it is, it's still just a fancy way to say you let others do all the work. Consider me unconvinced.\nLinhardt: I'll consider you a bother and leave it at that. You and Edelgard work far too hard. I mean it. Take a break now and then. If you both collapsed, I think it'd be too much effort for me to bother with. Get some rest, Hubert. Not as much as me, of course.\nHubert: Fine._null_null_null_null_
23_34_Hubert: Petra. Industrious as ever, I see.\nPetra: Hello, Hubert. Yes, I am trying to be... industrious. I must be working hard to improve my position. Right now it is not a good one.\nHubert: Even accounting for that, your efforts are impressive. I wish a little of you would rub off on certain people here. One troublesome slouch in particular.\nPetra: Rub? I will not be rubbing on anyone!\nHubert: Not literally. I would never have imagined you would adjust so well to life in Fódlan. When I first met you, you couldn't understand a single word of the language. You had the look of a cornered animal. So much so I thought you'd grown up in the wild.\nPetra: I had more youth then. And the experience was... terrifying. My grandfather ordered me to go to Fódlan with suddenness. I was stolen to a strange land filled with strange people. The treatment I was receiving was like... like I was a strange beast.\nHubert: It is unfortunate, but while you were called our guest, you were actually a hostage. You were meant to be insurance that Brigid would not restore its alliance with Dagda and attack us. The Empire required leverage, and after all, you are the princess of Brigid.\nPetra: It gave me sadness to leave my home, but I am not unhappy that I came to the Empire. I have learned much understanding from the outside world. My experience has made me become who I am. And meeting you and Lady Edelgard has had great value for me.\nHubert: I admire your spirit in the face of adversity. You set a strong example to follow. And there is much more adversity to come._Hubert: Looking out toward Brigid, are you?\nPetra: Yes. There are some times I cannot stop my thoughts from going home. It will be much time before I return. Brigid feels... far away.\nHubert: It is quite a long way. To say nothing of the sea that lies between here and there. Being unable to return must further add to the distance in your mind.\nPetra: It is as you say. When I return to Brigid... I will be the new queen. I am wishing to help relations with the Empire.\nHubert: I believe you will be successful. You may not be Lady Edelgard's equal, but you are resourceful enough to make an excellent queen. And, unlike Lady Edelgard, you will not be forced to harden your heart.\nPetra: Not Edelgard's equal, is that what you are saying?\nHubert: Understand that I mean no disrespect by this. But it is a fact that you are far beneath her. Make no mistake about what would happen if you were to raise your banner in revolt against her. She would crush you mercilessly.\nPetra: That is not a difference of equal... of equality. It is a difference of power.\nHubert: Even if our homelands were on equal footing, Lady Edelgard would still prevail.\nPetra: I can see with clarity the difference between me and Lady Edelgard. But that has no matter. I would never lose.\nHubert: How amusing. For your sake, you had better hope you are right._Petra: Hubert, I have a request to give you, if I may be doing that?\nHubert: Hello, Petra. How unusually formal.\nPetra: You are always comparing me against Edelgard. I have been observing you, and you are not often making comparisons like that. So why are you always comparing me? I do not enjoy being compared.\nHubert: Hmm. An astute observation. I should point out that such a comparison only reflects well on you. I am perhaps doing so because you are both royalty.\nPetra: That is not making sense to me... In battle, you and I are the same. Neither of us has a higher rank than general. Edelgard is leading the entire army, but you and I are both leading a part of the army. That should be making us... what is it... Ah! Comrades in arms.\nHubert: Comrades in arms, you say...\nPetra: When you are looking at me, you are thinking of me compared to Edelgard. But I want you to be looking at me only as myself. Do you have understanding? I do not want you seeing me as foreign royalty, but as your comrade in arms, who is working with you at your side.\nHubert: Ah. I understand you, now. It seems I've done you a great disservice, Petra. Your friendship is important to me. I am sorry that I've failed to make that clear. By comparing you to Lady Edelgard, I have treated you merely as one chasing after her shadow. I have done so even while believing that the Empire and Brigid would never go to war again.\nPetra: Do you really think you can stop comparing? I am knowing well that Edelgard takes a big place inside your heart.\nHubert: I do not fully understand it, but when I look at you, I simply cannot help but think of Her Majesty. Your past, full of hardship. Your unwavering determination. Your uncommon excellence. As such, I cannot promise never to compare you. But I will try my best to do so less often.\nPetra: Hm... For now, that will be OK. But I will not be giving up on this. And I want you knowing that one day, when you are comparing, you will be finding I have won the comparison.\nHubert: Heh. What an amusing thing to say. Lady Edelgard's face would contort most bitterly were she to hear it.\nPetra: Be marking my words, Hubert. One day, between the two of us, you will be choosing me._null_null_null_
23_39_Shamir: What is it, Hubert?\nHubert: Nothing in particular. I was just recalling your impressive skill with a bow. I'm willing to bet you could put an arrow through the neck of an enemy general from quite a distance. In fact, to any leader's bodyguard, I would go so far as to say you pose the most dangerous kind of threat.\nShamir: Don't worry your fragile little self. Your lady princess is safe. I wouldn't shoot my employer.\nHubert: I would certainly hope not. But there are some mercenaries to whom a contract means little. And you would do well to remember that Lady Edelgard is no mere \"princess.\" You should take care to learn the proper form of address for your employer.\nShamir: I said \"lady.\" I already told you. I'm not going to break the princess's contract.\nHubert: What did I just say?\nShamir: Proper address. Right. Next time.\nHubert: My patience has limits, you know. For the moment, you may stand in Lady Edelgard's good graces. But if you become a problem, I will not hesitate to eliminate you.\nShamir: You're unstable, Hubert. Be careful who you threaten. I don't take kindly to those who get in the way of my contracts.\nHubert: Is that a threat?\nShamir: Just some advice._Hubert: That's the last of them.\n???: Argh!\nHubert: Another threat to Her Majesty? Who's there?\nShamir: It's me. You owe me for that one.\nHubert: Shamir. What are you doing here?\nShamir: Same thing you are. But I'm after a particular target. The dark side of the Knights of Seiros is proving troublesome. I should have known, having been one.\nHubert: I was...negligent. I had thought we'd sufficiently thinned the numbers of these scum. Seems I was mistaken. In any case, you have my thanks.\nShamir: Save it. Just doing my job.\nHubert: Even so—killing your former allies. Do you feel no remorse whatsoever?\nShamir: You wouldn't, so why ask?\nHubert: You are not me. Answer the question.\nShamir: What's it matter? I owed a debt to Rhea. I served in the Knights of Seiros to repay her. I repaid that debt. Now I'm here. I'm sure it was considered dishonorable of me to leave, but that's none of my concern. I have no connection to the Seiros faith, nor to the ways of Fódlan.\nHubert: That's right. You're from Dagda. Well, consider me glad you're on the right side. At least for the time being.\nShamir: You worry too much. Watch out, or it'll be the death of you._Hubert: All finished. Time to go.\nHubert: You really must stop sneaking up on me, Shamir.\nShamir: And what if I don't? I can take you.\nHubert: Maybe. Either way, it's a waste to fight an ally.\nShamir: We're allies now? I guess I should be more careful with you. Are you sure it was right to kill them? I believe your mistress told you to let them go.\nHubert: That is exactly what I will say I did. But leaving them alive would have been a mistake. I did what had to be done.\nShamir: Is that so? Maybe you're not just some sycophant. It takes guts to disobey a direct order.\nHubert: Lady Edelgard's time is rightfully occupied with a great deal of concern and contemplation. Her affairs are of far greater consequence than a trifle like this. Much rests on the decisions she makes. But little details of this kind happen to be my area of expertise. So I simply handle them. Better that than to burden her with needless debate.\nShamir: Logical through and through, aren't you?\nHubert: That is how I do things.\nShamir: I like people who are thorough.\nHubert: You seem quite thorough in your methods as well.\nShamir: As a rule, I am. Regarding decisions, I planned on leaving Fódlan after completing my contract... But now I'm starting to think I might stay here.\nHubert: Stay here? I'm forced to wonder what your intentions might be.\nShamir: I have no ulterior motives. I've just grown a little fond of you.\nHubert: Excuse me? You've what?\nShamir: For someone so intelligent, you're very dense. It's not just about you though. I've learned to like Lady Edelgard and most everyone else here as well. I wouldn't mind staying on to work as your specialist.\nHubert: It's a fine offer. But perhaps we should wait until after the war to discuss it thoroughly.\nShamir: Fair, but you owe me, remember?\nHubert: Not much I can say to that, is there?_null_null_null_
