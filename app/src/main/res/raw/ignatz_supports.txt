24_41_Ignatz: Hm. Hmm…\n(Byleth enters)\n\nByleth: …\nIgnatz: Uhh... Mmm...\nByleth: …\nIgnatz: OK. I've decided on the composition.\nByleth: Composition?\nIgnatz: That's right, the composition for my next paint... Wait! Professor? How long have you been standing there? You haven't been watching me, have you? Uh, no, I misspoke! Did I say painting? I meant to say, uh...\nByleth: You paint?\nIgnatz: Well, I've thought for a while that it might be nice to paint the scenery here. The contours of that tree, set against the stark shapes of the faraway peaks... Of course, I only paint after I've finished my chores. I'd never put my at before my responsibilities! My studies are paramount. I shall always uphold my duties as a student of the Officers Academy! Whereas art is...a hobby of mine, you might say. Everyone has hobbies, right? I'm sure you have one.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No, none.\nChoice 2: Nothing comes to mind.\nIgnatz: Oh! Well, perhaps it's different for you, Professor. But it's perfectly normal for people to have hobbies. Reading, for instance. Or fishing, or taking midday naps. For me, it's making art. Hobbies are healthy! They're a good way of relieving stress. You might consider taking up a hobby, Professor. Anything to clear your mind. Think about it. It's much easier to focus if you're feeling refreshed. There isn't a rule against hobbies, is there? If you tell me to stop, I'll stop. I shall never again put brush to canvas!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's not what I'm saying.\nChoice 2: Paint as much as you like.\nIgnatz: Really? It's OK for me to paint? Well... I mean, if you're sure. But really, it's nothing more than a little diversion. A frivolous pastime. Um, I think I ought to go back to my quarters now, if it's all the same to you._Ignatz: All right, time to sneak off and do some painting... Professor! S-such lovely weather today, huh? I was, ah, just about to go for a walk.\nByleth: Why are you bringing paper?\nIgnatz: What, this? No, it's uh... Oh, I'm sorry, Professor. I'll admit it. I was going to do some painting. You remember the place where we talked before? I've been painting the scenery there. I'm still keeping up with my academics and training, of course! I just painting my spare time as a change of pace.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm not accusing you.\nChoice 2: You don't have to hide it.\nIgnatz:\nChoice 1 response: Oh. You're not? Ah, well, yes, I suppose you're not.\nChoice 2 response: Oh. I don't? Ah, well, yes. Maybe you're right.\nIgnatz: I may have gotten ahead of myself. I'm sorry for panicking there. Honestly...I'm just worried that my father will find out that I've been painting.\nByleth: I'm not going to tell him.\nIgnatz: Of course. Why would you go out of your way to tell him that? Completely illogical of me. But it seems I've developed a bit of complex about it. My father's not a fan of my artistic pastime, you see. We're a merchant family, and my older brother is set to inherit the business. As for me, my father decided I should be a knight. That's why I'm at the academy. Painting won't help me become a knight. It's a waste of time...\nByleth: Is that why you feel guilty about it?\nIgnatz: Well, yes. I feel like I'm betraying my parents. I hear that business has been slow for them over the past few years. If I become a knight for an influential noble house, I could use my connections to help support them. My father was determined to send me here. He must have been, considering the enormous amount of money he spent. I don't think I'm well suited to being a knight. My parents sent me to the academy for their sake, not my own. When I think about how hard my family is working just to stay in business, how can I sit idly by? All of which is just to say that painting will have to remain my little hobby, nothing more. Not that I could make a career out of it, even if I want to. That's just a fantasy._Ignatz: How incredible. What a striking color. Ah, Professor! Look at this stone. Such a brilliant blue. You don't normally find stones like this around here. I ought to grind it down. I wonder if it would still be the same color.\nByleth: Why would you grind it down?\nIgnatz: To make pigment for my art! Good supplies don't come cheap. I prefer to make my own. Blue is especially expensive. How fortunate that I chanced upon this remarkable blueness! Oh, I'm sorry. There I go again, blathering on and on about painting.\nByleth: Well, it's just a hobby, right?\nIgnatz: Oh yes, but I know that I can get rather caught up in it and, ah, enthusiastic. You know, Professor, no matter how impassioned I become about my art, you never hold it against me. One could argue that I'm better off preparing for our next battle. I am becoming a knight.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Wouldn't you rather become an artist?\nChoice 2: You should become an artist.\nIgnatz: Oh, Professor. Please don't say things like that. I gave up on my artistic dreams long ago. To support my family, I will be a knight. That's that.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Will you regret that choice?\nChoice 2: You'll regret that choice.\nIgnatz:\nChoice 1 response: No. I know it's the right thing to do.\nChoice 2 response: No, I won't. I'm doing the right thing.\nIgnatz: I'll continue with my art as a hobby. I don't think I could ever give it up. When I see something beautiful, I can't suppress the urge to paint it. I don't have a choice. And if my art can bring happiness to even one person, that's good enough for me.\nByleth: As long as you're sure.\nIgnatz: …Professor, I have a favor to ask. I'm painting a portrait right now. When it's finished, I'd like to give the piece to you. Would you take it? Perhaps it can bring you a little happiness. That will have made the effort well worth it.\n(Byleth nods)\n\nIgnatz: Oh, excellent! Is that a promise? Because I'm really going to put my heart into it. Ah, that is. I'm going to enjoy partaking in this casual hobby of mine!_null_null_null_

You weren't supposed to show it to anyone...but you hung it in the reception hall!\nByleth: It's beautiful. You should be proud.\nIgnatz: Because of all that you've done… Now everyone knows...including my father. He's heard so much praise that he and my brother want to see it. He even told me that I should be an artist. That I'm more likely to succeed as an artist than a knight.\nByleth: That's good, isn't it?\nIgnatz: Yes. I've dreamed of being an artist for so long... I stopped believing it would actually happen. You know, for that painting, I thought of the most beautiful thing in the world.\nByleth: The goddess, you mean?\nIgnatz: Well, yes. It was a portrait of Sothis, the goddess who descended from heaven to guide humanity. But when I was painting her, I couldn't stop thinking of you. You are the most beautiful thing in the world. And beyond that... OK, here goes nothing. I want you to please accept this. Please. Do you...accept? I can't measure up to you. You're the hero of Fódlan, and I'm just a painter. But I can't lie to myself any longer. I can't live my whole life denying myself what makes me the happiest. You taught me that. Taught me to see myself. You taught me everything. You've always been so patient and attentive. You never made me feel small, or denied my feelings. You soothed my troubled soul. You are my goddess. I want to be with you for the rest of my life...to love you for all eternity. I want to paint your beauty in portrait after portrait. I want to stay by your side—for now, and forever. Will you let me?\nByleth: I would be honored.\nIgnatz: What?! Did you say what I think you said? You're accepting me as your partner? I asked you because I didn't want to live with the regret of not asking. I decided to be honest, expecting you to spurn me, and yet... You said yes. You said yes! You said—\nByleth: Ignatz! Get a hold of yourself!\nIgnatz: Ah, right, sorry. Whew. I almost fainted there. You're sure though? Absolutely positive?\nByleth: I'm sure.\n(S Support Artwork)\n\n* Ignatz: Then I promise to do whatever it takes to be a respectable man, worthy of your partnership. With my paintings, I will bring the world happiness! The same happiness that I feel when I look at you, my beloved goddess. Sorry, was that too much? Maybe I should just leave it at this... I love you. With all of my soul.
24_34_(Ignatz and Petra walking towards each other)\n\nIgnatz: Aaah!\n(Ignatz and Petra collide and Ignatz falls down; screen fades to black, and Ignatz' glasses are gone)\n\nIgnatz: Ah, ow, ouch! Oh, my glasses! Where are they? Where are they?!\nPetra: Please take my apologies, Ignatz. I did not have enough care.\nIgnatz: That's OK, Petra. Just… Have you seen my glasses?\nPetra: Glasses… Ah, yes! Transparent lenses for viewing things.\nIgnatz: Yes, exactly, yes.\nPetra: Hmm, your face looks different without the glasses.\nIgnatz: Ah, well, I dropped them. That's why I'm looking for them.\nPetra: Are these them?\n(screen fades back in; Ignatz has his glasses back on)\n\nIgnatz: Ah! Thank the goddess. I thought I might be in trouble there.\nIgnatz: Are you OK, Petra? You're not hurt?\nPetra: I have no wounds. And you?\nIgnatz: I'm OK too. Thank you.\nPetra: That is goodness. How long have you needed the lenses, anyway?\nIgnatz: Hm? Oh, ages. I can't see without them.\nIgnatz: You've never used glasses, I gather. I guess you don't need them.\nPetra: In Brigid, glasses are not existing. I think all of our eyes must be good there.\nIgnatz: I kind of figured. I'm a little jealous, to tell the truth.\nPetra: Inside the shadows, dangerous beasts are lurking. If you cannot see, you cannot live.\nIgnatz: So bad eyesight means death? Brigid sounds scary.\nPetra: You need to have sight for hunting too. If not, you will starve until death.\nIgnatz: Oh yeah, lots of hunting in Brigid, right? I guess that requires good eyesight.\nPetra: I wonder why eyes would change and need lenses…_Petra: Ignatz! I am having a request.\nIgnatz: Huh? For me?\nPetra: Yes. Only you can be helping me.\nIgnatz: Something only I can do? That's a lot of pressure. What's it about?\nPetra: I want to borrow your lens...your glasses. I have curiosity.\nIgnatz: Oh, you want to try my glasses! All right.\nPetra: I have so much gratitude! I will be trying them now.\n(screen fades to black; Petra is wearing Ignatz's glasses)\n\nIgnatz: So, Petra, what do you think?\nPetra: The world appears...blurred. My head feels dizzy.\nPetra: The danger for being sick is now...very high.\nIgnatz: Whaaa?! Petra, take them off!\nIgnatz: If you lean on me that hard, I'm going to… Aaah!\n(Ignatz falls down; screen fades in, Ignatz is now wearing his glasses again)\n\nIgnatz: How are you feeling?\nPetra: I am feeling much better now. You have my thanks.\nIgnatz: You're...welcome? I guess you shouldn't wear glasses unless you need them.\nPetra: Yes. I do not have friendliness with glasses.\nPetra: Like Heroes' Relics, only certain people can be using them.\nIgnatz: Haha! Glasses are like Heroes' Relics! What a funny thing to say.\nPetra: It is not for a joke…\nPetra: I was saying the truth.\nPetra: Your glasses are only for you to use. But I give thanks for you showing them to me.\n(Petra leaves)\n\nIgnatz: Petra's always so serious. Relics, glasses… I never thought about it like that._(Training Grounds)\n(black screen with sword slashes)\n\nPetra: Ha! Hyah! Ha!\n(screen fades in)\n\nIgnatz: Petra. You always seem so focused on your training.\nPetra: Ignatz. Are you wanting something from me?\nIgnatz: I want to apologize about the glasses debacle.\nPetra: Apologize? I will give you my forgiveness, but I am not understanding.\nIgnatz: When I laughed at what you said. I felt really bad for doing that.\nIgnatz: I'm realizing that I can learn a lot from you.\nPetra: You are learning new things from me? What kind of learning?\nIgnatz: Nothing specific, but more like… You really take things seriously.\nIgnatz: You approach the world with genuine curiosity and consider it carefully.\nIgnatz: You have a sincere, wholehearted approach to learning new things. I envy that.\nPetra: I am thinking you also have great seriousness. That is why you are worrying.\nPetra: But your worrying is not necessary.\nIgnatz: You think so? That's kind of reassuring…\nPetra: Also, you have much kindness.\nPetra: You are apologizing for the smallest of things. Your heart is overfilled with compassion.\nPetra: You have honesty too. You are a good person.\nIgnatz: Me? Oh, I think that's going too far.\nPetra: You are also having the ability to wear lenses! You are like...a hero chosen by the lenses.\nIgnatz: Because I wear glasses?\nPetra: That final one was joking. I do not always have to be serious.\nIgnatz: That was a joke? I didn't realize. I guess it was OK for me to laugh after all.\nIgnatz: You always look so humorless. It's hard to judge.\nIgnatz: Oh, I don't mean that in a bad way! You're a fun person to be around.\nIgnatz: I'll know that you're joking next time, without you telling me.\nPetra: It is greatly important for us to be understanding each other.\nIgnatz: I think so too! I've been hoping to learn more about you.\nPetra: Then we can be spending much more time with each other and learning much!_null_null_null_
24_33_Mercedes: Oh my, Ignatz. You're in a hurry. Is something the matter?\nIgnatz: The professor wants us to gather at the training grounds. Didn't you hear?\nMercedes: Of course I did! I'll head over in a bit.\nIgnatz: Um. Are you sure you want to wait? I can hear the professor calling.\nMercedes: We're not needed until after the lunch hour. We have plenty of time.\nIgnatz: Oh, I guess so. I was just panicking a bit. I wish I could be calm like you. How are you so unflappable?\nMercedes: Well, rushing around doesn't help, does it? I mostly try to stay out of everyone's way. There's no point in overexerting yourself. Anything that needs doing will get done eventually.\nIgnatz: Hm! So that's the secret to happiness.\nMercedes: I suppose, but it's not nearly as philosophical as you make it sound.\nIgnatz: No, it's perfect. I feel like I don't quite fit in with other people. So in situations like this where I have to talk to someone, I panic a little. Please, teach me how to be as calm and collected as you are.\nMercedes: Honestly, Ignatz, you're making this out to be much bigger than it is. I mostly just don't pay attention. Being like me is more trouble than it's worth.\nIgnatz: But you always seem so happy! Agh, I'm sorry...\nMercedes: There's no need to apologize. Come on, let's head to the training grounds. I may slow you down though.\nIgnatz: All right. We don't have to rush... But I'm going to anyway. See you there!\n(Ignatz runs off)\n\nMercedes: Goodness! Don't strain yourself!_Ignatz: …\nMercedes: Oh, Ignatz. What are you sighing over?\nIgnatz: Sorry! I shouldn't sigh in such a holy place.\nMercedes: There's nothing wrong with it. I sigh here all the time. The goddess receives all our prayers and our sighs. What's bothering you? I'd be happy to talk about it, if you'd like.\nIgnatz: Oh, it's nothing. Not worth talking about.\nMercedes: Is that so? Am I not worth talking to?\nIgnatz: That's not what I meant! Sorry to offend you. I'll tell you about it. I'm just uncertain about my future. My father wants me to be a knight. I don't think I can handle it. Can you imagine a knight as pathetic as me?\nMercedes: I don't find you pathetic at all. Is there something you would rather pursue?\nIgnatz: Well, I've always loved painting.\nMercedes: You want to become an artist? How wonderful!\nIgnatz: What's your ambition?\nMercedes: Me? I simply want to help people with their troubles. Those who can't help themselves. I've considered working for the church, but that's only a vague idea… I haven't spent much time considering how I would go about that though... Oh, I'm sorry. We were supposed to be discussing your troubles.\nIgnatz: Not at all. I'm actually feeling a little better. Knowing that you aren't sure about your future, I don't feel quite so...alone.\nMercedes: Everyone in this world feels a little lost, you know. I really do believe that the life of an artist is a wonderful dream to pursue.\nIgnatz: There was a beautiful painting of the goddess in the church where I used to live. Whenever times were difficult, I would stare up at her and sigh. Thinking about that painting helps me even now. I've always wanted to paint the goddess.\nMercedes: You should! I'm sure your painting will help someone else in their time of need.\nIgnatz: I can't paint anything powerful enough to do that. I wish I could. Maybe one day… I'll give that some thought. Thank you, Mercedes._Mercedes: Are you praying, Ignatz? Are you concerned about something?\nIgnatz: A little. I'm coming to accept that I will never be an artist. I'm self-taught, so my style and technique are probably all wrong. I don't know what I'm doing. Besides, how could I persuade my father? I can't even imagine his reaction. He'd disown me.\nMercedes: It takes courage to stray from the path that has been set out before you. It's never easy. I'm in a similar position. I have been carrying out my adoptive father's wishes up until this point. But...\nIgnatz: But? It's never a bad thing to have dreams. That's how I feel, at least. I can't imagine a life in which I've given up on my dreams.\nMercedes: How could anyone find happiness in that? Even with your father's demands, you can still work toward one small dream at a time.\nIgnatz: You know, I suppose you're right! My dream of being an artist gives me the energy to go on. You're really wise, Mercedes.\nMercedes: Oh, goodness. That's not how most people would describe me. I just don't want you to give up on your art. Besides, I genuinely do want to see your painting of the goddess.\nIgnatz: Really?! I'm pleased to hear you say so! You said you're in the same position as I am. What did you mean by that?\nMercedes: My future has been decided for me as well. I'm to be married off to a nobleman.\nIgnatz: What?!\nMercedes: Is it really that surprising? I think many young women face the same fate.\nIgnatz: So, um... Will you get married?\nMercedes: Hmm... I suppose I haven't given it much thought. Whatever may happen, I'm sure everything will work out in the end if I don't give up on my dreams.\nIgnatz: \"Everything will work out in the end.\" Mercedes, you're amazing. I think that, whatever you do, wherever you go, you'll help a lot of people. You're so kind, I know you can— Oh!\nMercedes: What's wrong, Ignatz? You have a strange look on your face.\nIgnatz: For my whole life, I've wanted to paint the goddess. But I never could. Whatever shape I gave her, she never seemed quite right. But it's just come to me. It's wonderful how inspiration can strike so suddenly!\nMercedes: Quick! Paint before you lose it!\nIgnatz: I will! Will you help me?\nMercedes: I'd be happy to help, but I'm not sure what I can do.\nIgnatz: Don't you see? The goddess I imagined and tried to paint so many times—she's you! I have to get my supplies. Stay right there.\n(Ignatz leaves)\n\nMercedes: Well! To say such a thing directly before the altar! That must be some kind of sin… I'll say an extra prayer for him._null_null_null_
24_25_Ignatz: …\nIngrid: Hey, Ignatz, what are you doing here?\nIgnatz: …\nIngrid: Uh, hello? Oh! You're painting.\nIgnatz: Ingrid! What are you doing here?\nIngrid: I could ask you the same! I...did ask you the same. Anyway, I'm just visiting the cathedral. I must say, that painting is looking wonderful!\nIgnatz: Aaaaah! Don't look, don't look!\nIngrid: Why not? It really looks great.\nIgnatz: Really?\nIngrid: I wouldn't lie. Let me have a look. Oh, it's the statue of Saint Seiros.\nIgnatz: I hope you don't think I was ignoring you. When I'm painting, I get totally absorbed.\nIngrid: Of course not. My feelings aren't hurt so easily. Hmm, what if you gave her a more edgy outfit? Shorten up her skirt or something?\nIgnatz: No! That would be improper!\nIngrid: Ooh, and how about making her sword bigger? Oh! Oh! Turn her into a valiant knight!\nIgnatz: But she's not a knight.\nIngrid: Aw, come on. Just this once?\nIgnatz: …\nIngrid: Huh...She doesn't exactly look like a knight. More like a maniacal demigod...\nIgnatz: Yeah, it just kinda came out that way.\nIngrid: It's...different. Not quite how I envisioned.\nIgnatz: It's my fault. I should have stuck to my original idea.\nIngrid: I'm sorry I pushed you, Ignatz. I'll leave you be._Ingrid: Good day, Ignatz! So, painting again?\nIgnatz: Ingrid! Yes, I'm painting Saint Seiros again.\nIngrid: Look... I'm really sorry about the last time. It's my fault it turned out so... well, different.\nIgnatz: No, no need to apologize. I appreciated the fresh input. It made me think.\nIngrid: That's kind of you to say but there's no need to pull punches.\nIgnatz: It's the truth! I'm so caught up in my own mind. I'd never have thought to try that.\nIngrid: Ignatz, I appreciate your attitude, but...\nIgnatz: Yes?\nIngrid: There are times when it's OK to feel upset or angry. It you're feeling that way, it's always best to be honest.\nIgnatz: But, but-\nIngrid: I understand the weight of what I did. I besmirched a sacred image— and it was a painting you were pouring your heart into. I got carried away, but I'd prefer if you had told me then and there that my request was uncalled for.\nIgnatz: I'm not angry. I could never get angry with you. I'm sorry.\nIngrid: Why are you apologizing? I'm the one apologizing!\nIgnatz: Oh! Sorry!\nIngrid: Stop saying sorry! Ugh, never mind. Forgive me. I came here to apologize, and now I'm being sharp with you...\nIgnatz: Don't worry, it's my fault, really. I'm not very good at expressing myself.\nIngrid: I never intended to be such a bother. I think I'll leave you to it.\nIgnatz: Oh, OK. Sorry._Ignatz: Where are you going, Ingrid?\nIngrid: Oh! Uh, hi! I see you spotted me-um, saw me. I don't want to disturb you.\nIgnatz: Don't worry. I just finished my painting of Saint Seiros.\nIngrid: Oh, that's wonderful. May I see?\nIgnatz: Of course! Take a look.\nIngrid: Whoa. She looks so different from the other painting. Much more divine and gentle.\nIgnatz: She looks so real, doesn't she? So alive. Perhaps it's boastful for me to say that.\nIngrid: Not at all! She really does! She has a glowing vibrancy to her. Looking at this painting, I feel so inspired.\nIgnatz: I was going to paint her as loving and benevolent. But then I remembered your idea, and I decided to depict her fighting for her people.\nIngrid: Really? Actually, now that I look closer, I see her sword is rather large. And she seems to be in a battle stance!\nIgnatz: That's right. Although, of course, I had to discard some of your more absurd suggestions.\nIngrid: I'm sorry about that.\nIgnatz: No, wait! That's not what I meant! I see that if I open myself up to suggestions from other people, new things become possible. And I have you to thank for that realization.\nIngrid: If that's true, I'm very glad I could help.\nIgnatz: You made a good point. We can't be blinded by our own thought patterns and ideas. It's important to be open to others', as well. By doing so, we discover new paths for ourselves, and we can even become better in ways we may never have imagined.\nIngrid: Exactly! Thank you, Ignatz. You've reminded me of a very valuable lesson. I'm going to strive to be more attentive and listen to other people's ideas.\nIgnatz: Me too. And I've just had a new idea for a painting!\nIngrid: I can't wait to see it. I bet it'll be a masterpiece!_Ignatz: ...\nIngrid: Always diligently working on your craft.\nIgnatz: Agh! Ingrid! How long were you standing there?\nIngrid: Only just now. Oh! Is that the new painting you were mentioning? You sounded especially inspired about this one. May I see?\nIgnatz: No! I mean... The painting's not ready yet. I don't want anyone to see it before it's finished.\nIngrid: But...we had spoken about how much your perspective can broaden when you let other people in on your work. Had a change of heart?\nIgnatz: It's not that. This one is embarrassing, is all.\nIngrid: Come on-you know you don't need to feel embarrassed around me. Please, show me!\nIgnatz: Uh, all right. Just for a second.\nIngrid: This one is even more beautiful than the last! A knight in shimmering armor, fighting in all her glory! That lance looks a lot like mine! And the armor... and the horse... Um, Ignatz... Is...that...\nIgnatz: Yes. It's you.\nIngrid: The woman in this image—she's so powerful and regal... I'm in awe. So elegant and refined, but with such a soft air, despite the armor and weaponry...\nIgnatz: That's how I see you. You remind me of Saint Seiros. Brave and vibrant and powerful, yet kind and gentle. Sorry! Was that too much? That was too much.\nIngrid: Thank you, Ignatz. I'm deeply touched. And also embarrassed.\nIgnatz: I'm feeling a little embarrassed myself.\nIngrid: Truly. I'm so moved. I guess now I really need to live up to all your painting encompasses! Please show it to me once it's finished.\nIgnatz: I will. I promise. Though I don't think I'll show it to anyone else._A+_null_
24_29_Lorenz: Ignatz. Let us take a short break. I will pour tea. Please choose a teapot for us to use.\nIgnatz: You want me to pick one?\nLorenz: I don't see any other Ignatz around here, do you? Go on, now, we're wasting time. The pots are over here. I will leave the selection to your judgement.\nIgnatz: Ah. Let's see... How about this?\nLorenz: That's rather plain. Why did you choose that one?\nIgnatz: The tea you chose has a very subtle taste, as well as a smooth, light texture. Such an unassuming tea calls for an unassuming pot, and one that complements the tea's color. In addition, the pot I selected has a floral design. Although we can't go for a walk today, we can still bask a little in nature's beauty.\nLorenz: Very interesting. You know, you have an absolutely marvelous aesthetic eye. Precisely what I would expect from the son of a merchant house that has enjoyed the Gloucesters' patronage for so many years. After we graduate, when you begin your trade in earnest, I will introduce you to my father.\nIgnatz: Oh... That sounds wonderful. But I'm afraid I'm already on the path to becoming a knight.\nLorenz: Ah, right. You are a second son. Still, your eye for beauty is a talent that should not go to waste. Very well, if you are to be a knight, then I shall happily take you into my service.\nIgnatz: Ah, well... Hm.\nLorenz: What? Does that displease you?\nIgnatz: Not at all! I just need a little time to think it over.\n(Ignatz leaves)\n\nLorenz: His eye for the arts is unwavering, but in all other matters he is woefully indecisive._Ignatz: …\nLorenz: Ignatz! Hello. What you up to?\nIgnatz: Aaah! You frightened me!\nLorenz: Oh, calm yourself. What is it that you're drawing?\nIgnatz: I thought I'd jot down some sketches of everyone while they're training. And then, later on, I'll try to practice their moves on my own. But I can't really concentrate on sketching if someone's watching me...\nLorenz: Just sketches, hm? Even so, they're lovely. There's such life in them, it's as if they are moving on the page before my very eyes.\nIgnatz: Y-you really think so? You know, I always hoped to be an artist.\nLorenz: With skills like that, I'm quite certain you could easily make a living of it. And your demeanor is different when you draw. Bolder, somehow. Ah — yes, there's an idea! Perhaps in the future, you will join my retinue as my personal painter! Wait, have we not discussed this arrangement already? I had decided to take you into my service as a knight, had I not?\nIgnatz: Becoming a knight was my father's idea... Being an artist is out of the question, I'm afraid.\nLorenz: So you've said. Well then, I suppose you shall simply have to become a knight who also paints.\nIgnatz: A knight... who also paints?\nLorenz: I have seen your talent and can attest to it. Your gifts are too great to wither away in obscurity. A knight with the rare gift of artistic talent would be most welcome in my employ.\nIgnatz: Heh. I had never thought of that! Still, I don't understand why you'd want me as one of your knights. As a fighter, I'm unremarkable.\nLorenz: There is more to knighthood than combat! Courtly manners, a dignified bearing, and an aesthetic sensibility are also essential. A knight with an eye for art, and the talent to create it, is sure to improve the image of the nobility.\nIgnatz: (with a laugh) Lorenz... I'd never have guessed you were prone to such eccentric ideas. Thank you. I'm feeling a little more confident after hearing your kind words.\nLorenz: No cause for thanks. It is a noble's duty to provide guidance to those in need._null_null_null_null_
24_35_Raphael: Yes! Time for food! Hey, Ignatz! Is this seat taken?\nIgnatz: Oh. Hey, Raphael... I'm done eating, so you can sit here if you like!\nRaphael: Really? But there's still food on your plate.\nIgnatz: Ah, it's fine, I'm not that hungry. Anyway, I guess I'll be heading off!\nRaphael: Oh. OK.\n(Scene transition)\n\nRaphael: Hey, Ignatz! Wanna train with me?\nIgnatz: Uh... Oh my! That equipment's looking rusty! Let me fetch some oil.\nRaphael: What's the matter? It always looks like that! Come on, we'll take care of it later.\nIgnatz: No, you have to do it as soon as you notice. There's oil in the warehouse. I'll be right back!\n(Ignatz leaves)\n(Scene transition)\n\nRaphael: Hey, Ignatz!\nIgnatz: Uh, hello, Raphael!\nRaphael: Are you busy? I need to talk to you.\nIgnatz: No, uh, that's... Oh, almost forgot, it's time to return this book to the library! I'll just...\nRaphael: Hey, hey, hey! Hold up! Are you seriously gonna keep running away from me?\nIgnatz: What? No! I'm not...running.\nRaphael: Yes, you are! Every time I try to talk to you, you make up some excuse and run! What's going on? You were a lot friendlier to me when we were kids. You were always so excited to show me all the neat stuff you had whenever I came to visit. We'd play hide-and-seek with my little sis, draw pictures and do other fun stuff too! Remember all that?\nIgnatz: Things...can't be the way they were. It's regrettable, but it's the truth.\nRaphael: Regrettable? What's there to regret?\nIgnatz: I mean, you know...what happened to your parents. My parents are the reason your parents died.\nRaphael: What're you talking about? My parents died in an accident while traveling for work.\nIgnatz: Maybe so, but they were taking over for mine because they had other business that day and couldn't go themselves. So, they recommended yours to fill in for them.\nRaphael: Huh... I didn't know that. But what does that have to do with our friendship?\nIgnatz: No, but see, I...\nRaphael: Oh, I see. But we're done talking about this. You gotta stop beating yourself up over it. It was an accident.\n(Raphael leaves)\n\nIgnatz: He's just putting on a brave face. No one is that forgiving..._(black screen; Raphael in the training grounds)\n\nRaphael: Yah! Hurr! Hyah!\n(screen fades in; Ignatz enters)\n\nRaphael: Hey, Ig—\n(Ignatz leaves)\n\nRaphael: I-Ignatz?\n(scene transition; Ignatz eating in the dining hall)\n\nIgnatz: Mmm... Ah.\n(Raphael enters)\n\nRaphael: Hey! Ignatz is here!\n(Ignatz leaves)\n\nRaphael: What's gotten into him?\n(scene transition; in Ignatz's room)\n(Raphael enters)\n\nIgnatz: …\nRaphael: Hey!\nIgnatz: Aaaaagh!\nRaphael: Hey, you've been acting weird lately. Are you sick or something?\nIgnatz: R-Raphael! No, I'm...fine...\nRaphael: So, what's going on with you? Are you worried about something? Wanna talk about it?\nIgnatz: I don't know about \"worried.\" It's just, you know, your parents...\nRaphael: Hey, now!\nIgnatz: Aaaagh! What is it?!\nRaphael: I thought I told you to drop it? Just forget about it!\nIgnatz: I can't just forget about it! You lost your parents! And when you were in need, my family did nothing to help you.\nRaphael: Well, what were they supposed to do about it? It's not like they killed my parents. And besides, that's our folks you're talking about. That's got nothing to do with us, right?\nIgnatz: I still can't help but feel responsible, like I owe you somehow!\nRaphael: Look, if you wanna do something, just be my pal like you used to. We can eat tasty meals together, play games, make jokes, and laugh until our bellies hurt!\nIgnatz: Are you sure that's what you want?\nRaphael: Of course it is! We were friends before, and there's no reason we can't be friends now!\nIgnatz: Raphael, I... Thank you. And I'm sorry about before._Raphael: …\nIgnatz: Hey, Raphael. Reading a letter?\nRaphael: Well, if it isn't ol' Ignatz! I got a message here from my sis.\nIgnatz: Oh, a letter from Maya! I haven't seen her in so long. I bet she's all grown up.\nRaphael: Nah, she's still a shrimp. It's been a while since I saw her, but she's probably only up to your shoulders.\nIgnatz: Wow, I can't believe she's gotten that tall!\nRaphael: I wrote to tell her about how we're friends again. Do you remember this?\nIgnatz: Is that the picture I drew for her?\nRaphael: She sent it along with the letter. I guess she held onto it since we were kids! All right. That's enough looking. She said to show it to you and send it right back.\nIgnatz: To think, she's handling my little doodle with such reverence! That warms my heart. I remember the day I gave Maya that drawing. She looked so happy. Before then, I never knew I could make people happy with art. It was a revelation. I've been drawing and painting ever since, in hopes of becoming an artist one day.\nRaphael: You're much better now, so it must be paying off! I bet you could be a real artist!\nIgnatz: No, that's not possible, I'm afraid. I have to consider my parents' wishes.\nRaphael: Who cares what your parents want? It's not like you're a noble or nothing. Your fate is your own!\nIgnatz: Huh, you think so?\nRaphael: I know so. And I'm gonna support you with whatever dream you got. OK. Lemme see... What's the first step to follow your dreams...oh! Got it! You should paint me!\nIgnatz: Uh, paint you?\nRaphael: Yeah! I want my little sis to know how good I'm doing here, so I gotta send her proof. Plus, she'll be doubly impressed if it's a painting you made!\nIgnatz: Hah, good point! I can certainly try to capture your likeness. I'll paint you with a warm, cheerful expression on your face, to bring Maya comfort.\nRaphael: My face? No way. You gotta get my muscles in there! Mostly my chest and arms.\nIgnatz: Are you sure that's what she'd want to see?\nRaphael: Wait! Before you start painting, I gotta get me a little more training in! If my muscles aren't bulging, then what's the point?\nIgnatz: I'm not sure about this..._null_null_null_
24_30_Ignatz: Good morning, Lysithea! Out for a stroll, are we? It's lovely weather for it. I might go wander outside myself. I'm sure I can see some beautiful sights.\nLysithea: Ignatz—hold still, will you?\nIgnatz: Uh, sure?\nLysithea: Your shoes are untied. It looks sloppy. Let me just fix it for you.\nIgnatz: Oh! Thank you for letting me know, but really, I'm perfectly capable of tying them myself.\nLysithea: Pfft, clearly that's not the case, otherwise this wouldn't be an issue. Now, hush.\nIgnatz: Um.\n(Scene transition)\n\nLysithea: There we go.\nIgnatz: Thanks...\nLysithea: You've also got awful bedhead.\nIgnatz: What?! But I examined myself in the mirror before leaving my quarters!\nLysithea: It's the back of your head. Quite unkempt. You really should get it together. I mean, really. You're born to a noble-adjacent merchant family, aren't you? You really should be more presentable.\nIgnatz: Sorry, Lysithea... You're always so perfectly put together. In fact I'd say you're perfect in all respects... I don't think I've seen you fail at anything.\nLysithea: Well, consider that if I make even the slightest misstep, everyone will treat me like a child. There's nothing I hate more than that...\nIgnatz: I see! Well, I think you're very mature. If anything you may be overdoing it somewhat. I mean, people treat me like a child sometimes. But I like it, because it reminds me that other people care about me. You know? No matter how much we stretch, some things are always beyond us. I think it's fine to be vulnerable and ask for help sometimes.\nLysithea: Ignatz, are you really lecturing me about how I conduct myself right now? You're a sheepish, unreliable scatterbrain who can only ever think about what others think of him! Perhaps you should worry about your own maturity before you start questioning mine. Although you certainly look the part of a baby, so maybe that's asking too much. Anyway, I've got things to do, so I'm going to go now.\nIgnatz: Uh, Lysithea, wait! Hey!\nLysithea: Outta my way. You're such a child, I swear...\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nIgnatz: That was uncalled for. After all, I am older than she is._Lysithea: Oh, hey. It's you. Going for a walk again today?\nIgnatz: No, I'm on cooking duty today, and I have to head into town for some groceries.\nLysithea: All on your own? Hm, I'd better go with you. I'd be worried if you went by yourself.\nIgnatz: No, please! I can manage on my own.\nLysithea: But won't you have a hard time carrying everything back?\nIgnatz: Not at all. I'll be fine. I'm just replacing a few ingredients. Also, I may not look it, but I'm actually quite strong. I've been exercising every day!\nLysithea: You're right—you don't look it. Your biceps are a fraction of the size of Raphael's. If you start fumbling around under the weight of all the groceries, and then you trip and spill everything everywhere... Look, I'm just saying, that could be your future. It could happen. It doesn't look pretty.\nIgnatz: That's what you think of me, huh?\nLysithea: Yep. You're honestly a bit of a mess.\nIgnatz: I see. If that's how you feel...\nLysithea: Oh, knock it off with the wounded puppy-dog eyes! As though I'm some sort of villain in your story...\nIgnatz: I'm sorry. That wasn't my intention. I'm just a bit sensitive, that's all. You're talking like you don't respect me.\nLysithea: I see. So now it's my fault? No matter how grown you seem to think you are, there's so much you're incapable of. You can play at being a mature adult, but it only ever complicates things. And that's exactly what makes you look like a child.\nIgnatz: Oh, enough already! Would you just leave me alone?!\nLysithea: Maybe I...went a bit far that time... But he's so stubborn despite his ineptitude. I can't just leave it be. He's so foolish—constantly making a mess of things. Wait... But then... No matter how much we stretch, some things are always beyond us. I think it's fine to be vulnerable and ask for help sometimes. What he said to me before... To everyone else, do I seem just like Ignatz?_Lysithea: Um, hey...\nIgnatz: Oh! Lysithea. Something I can do for you?\nLysithea: Can you help me out with my shopping?\nIgnatz: Yes, of course. You need me to carry stuff?\nLysithea: Actually, can you pick up some tea for me? I'd do it, but I'm drowning in work.\nIgnatz: You're so busy you can't go shopping? OK. Do you have a favorite kind of tea?\nLysithea: I'm not too picky. I just like having it around, really. Whatever's cheapest works for me. Here's some money.\nIgnatz: One question. Why me? You don't really need my help for this.\nLysithea: I just thought I could lean on you a bit. You know, rather than trying to do everything on my own.\nIgnatz: Right. I see. Well, good! I'm glad you decided to approach me. Ah, but, for this particular task, you might be better off doing it yourself.\nLysithea: Oh?\nIgnatz: There are so many different kinds of tea, and I'm not very discerning. What if I get you one you don't like? When I do my own shopping, I pick a tea at random. Otherwise I'd be paralyzed by all the choices. It's the same with food. Sometimes I stare and stare at the options and never decide.\nLysithea: You looked like you were just fine when you went to get groceries the other day.\nIgnatz: I really had to push myself to do that alone. I don't think I can do that again. Sorry...\nLysithea: Aha. So you've stopped trying to do things on your own, then?\nIgnatz: Yeah. Still, though... For today, how about you have some of my tea? If that'll do...\nLysithea: Sounds nice, sure. Do you mind brewing mine while you're at it?\nIgnatz: OK! Though I can't do it as skillfully as Lorenz, I'm afraid. I'll get it ready right away. Feel free to start focusing on your work.\nLysithea: Heh.\nIgnatz: What?\nLysithea: I mean, you seem plenty reliable to me.\nIgnatz: I do? Really? How so?\nLysithea: You're fun, you're easy to be around, and you rarely complain when you help others.\nIgnatz: Well, I'm just pouring you some tea. I'm not sure that qualifies as \"help.\"\nLysithea: It's not easy for me to rely on people, but with you, it's different.\nIgnatz: Well, there aren't many things I can do, frankly. What I can do, I will do! So if you need anything, ask me, and I'll try to help.\nLysithea: You really are unreliable, as it turns out! Guess I'll just have to take your word for it._null_null_null_
24_32_Marianne: Is that everything?\nIgnatz: Yes, that's the last of them. Thank you, Marianne. Just when I thought all the laundry was dry, the wind got stronger, and... By the time I realized what was happening, there were clothes dancing across the sky!\nMarianne: That must have been frustrating to watch.\nIgnatz: I didn't imagine that they would float all the way to the stables. Thanks again for helping me pick them up.\nMarianne: It was no trouble. They landed right at my feet.\nIgnatz: Well, now I can hang it all back up before sunset. Everything should be dry by the day's end. All right, I should get to... Ahhh!\nMarianne: Are you all right?\nIgnatz: Heh, uh-huh. The hamper's just a little heavier than it looks. Do you think you could give me a hand?\n(screen fades to black, then back in)\n\nIgnatz: Phew, we got here just in time. Thanks for the help hanging everything up.\nMarianne: It was nothing.\nIgnatz: Ah.\nMarianne: …\nIgnatz: …\nMarianne: Um...\nIgnatz: What is it?\nMarianne: I'm sorry. I know I'm not much fun to be around. I'm not very good at small talk either.\nIgnatz: Oh no, that's all right. After all, just look over there.\nMarianne: Huh? Oh! The flowers are lovely!\nIgnatz: They were mere buds until just the other day. Now look at those gorgeous blooms!\nMarianne: How wonderful...\nIgnatz: If we'd been chatting away, we might never have noticed them. Sure, the laundry was an ordeal, but...at least there was a silver lining.\nMarianne: …_Ignatz: Hey, Marianne. Are you there?\nMarianne: Yes. Can I help you?\nIgnatz: Do you have a minute?\nMarianne: Huh? Oh, um. I...\nIgnatz: Then, if you don't mind... Would you come with me for a moment?\n(scene transition)\n\nMarianne: So, um, did you need something from me?\nIgnatz: Yes, indeed. I have an urgent request.\nMarianne: Have I done something?\nIgnatz: Oh no, it's nothing like that! Really, you don't have to worry.\nMarianne: Um...\nIgnatz: Would you close your eyes, please?\nMarianne: Then, how will I know where I'm going?\nIgnatz: Just take my hand. That's it. There, right there. Perfect. Now open your eyes.\nMarianne: Oh! The town is glowing from the sunset.\nIgnatz: Yes. Isn't it beautiful?\nMarianne: Very much so.\nIgnatz: I was looking at it earlier, and I thought to myself, \"I have to show Marianne.\"\nMarianne: But...why me?\nIgnatz: Because you're always looking at your shoes! You never get a chance to appreciate the scenery.\nMarianne: Oh, I...\nIgnatz: See, the best thing about the scenery is, it's always changing—with the weather, the time of day, the season. So every view is unique, never to be repeated. If no one sees it, it's lost.\nMarianne: You could've just enjoyed it on your own...\nIgnatz: I wanted to share this beautiful landscape with you.\nMarianne: Thank you, I...I'm not sure what to say.\nIgnatz: Hey, that's OK. I won't try to express this beauty in words either. Just look and remember. This will make for a nice memory. And maybe...remember that I was here too.\nMarianne: I...I will. I really will._(training grounds. Marianne is speaking to two knights)\n\nIgnatz: Huh. What's that about?\n(scene transition)\n\nIgnatz: Marianne, I saw you on the training grounds earlier. It looked like there was an argument.\nMarianne: Oh, no. It was nothing.\nIgnatz: Are you sure? Nothing happened at this morning's training?\nMarianne: Well...\nIgnatz: OK. Tell me what happened.\nMarianne: I-I just couldn't keep up with the rest of the group... Everyone got so mad at me. They said something about looking into their eyes so I can read their movements, but I couldn't do it...\nIgnatz: They may have a point.\nMarianne: I'm a hindrance to everyone... I just—I can't do it!\nIgnatz: Of course not. That goes without saying.\nMarianne: …\nIgnatz: It's hard to accomplish anything on your own. Look at me! By myself, I'm worse than useless. Can you see where I'm going with this? To succeed, you have to cooperate. You can't do that if you're not paying attention to nonverbal cues.\nMarianne: Huh?\nIgnatz: Please, try looking up, looking people in the eye. You'll see some things that you've never seen before. People worry about you, and rely on you. You'll see that in your allies' faces. In a way, you'll see what they're thinking.\nMarianne: You...you may be right. I was my fault for looking down. Thank you, Ignatz... I appreciate your encouragement.\nIgnatz: Of course! Look. We both saw the sunset and appreciated in its beauty. Nature communicates without words. We can do the same. We don't need to speak to be understood. Stop staring at your feet! Look at us. That'll be a good start.\nMarianne: I can certainly try!\nIgnatz: …\nMarianne: I-is something wrong? Did I say something to upset you?\nIgnatz: Oh, no! To the contrary. I just realized I was missing something. A thing of remarkable beauty, right under my nose...\nMarianne: Remarkable beauty?\nIgnatz: Ah, what? Don't mind me!_null_null_null_
24_27_Ignatz: Oh, Professor! Here's the map you..\nIgnatz: Well... There's always next time, I suppose.\n(Scene transition)\n\nLeonie: Hey, Ignatz! Didn't you have something to talk to the professor about?\nIgnatz: Oh, no, nothing urgent. You didn't cut short your conversation because of me, did you?\nLeonie: Come on, do I seem like the type to do that? No, I just had a couple of questions about the bows. We're done now, so I thought I'd come and tell you.\nIgnatz: The bows? Is something wrong with them?\nLeonie: Lots of them have come in for repairs lately, so I switched out some of the strings for stronger ones. They've been breaking less, but now they're harder to draw.\nIgnatz: Ah, I see. I suppose people would prefer if you went back to the lighter bowstrings.\nLeonie: Maybe. If the only issue was draw weight, I'd just tell people to get stronger arms. But the real problem is that you can't shoot as fast. Arrows also fly too far now.\nIgnatz: I can see how slower shooting is a drawback, but the arrows flying father... That actually sounds like a good thing.\nLeonie: Sure, on open plains. But up close, you lose accuracy. That's why I thought it might be good to use different bowstrings for different scenarios. I wanted the professor's opinion about that.\nIgnatz: Oh, good point! You know a lot about bows, don't you?\nLeonie: Guess I do. I grew up in a hunting village, so I've been around them my whole life. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily better than anyone, but at least I know what I'm doing. And you? Do you have something you're really good at?\nIgnatz: Me? Oh, no. I don't think so.\nLeonie: Well, I'm sure you'll find your thing someday.\nIgnatz: I hope so._Leonie: Hngh... Who's there? Oh. Hey, Ignatz.\nIgnatz: I'm sorry! I didn't mean to interrupt you.\nLeonie: Relax. You're not interrupting.\nIgnatz: I'm sorry. I didn't know you were training out here.\nLeonie: I sometimes come here to practice by myself. It's more like a real battlefield, you know? Shooting the targets in the yard lets you train your aim and all, but the tension just isn't the same.\nIgnatz: You're right. A real battlefield feels quite different. But if that's the atmosphere you want, I feel even more like I'm intruding.\nLeonie: Oh, knock it off. You're already here. May as well stick around while I catch my breath.\nIgnatz: Ah, okay. Sorry. Thank you. Sorry to bother you.\nLeonie: You know you've said you're sorry about a dozen times since you got here?\nIgnatz: Oh, I'm so... Ah.\nLeonie: It's fine. I guess it's part of your charm. Hey, what's that bundle of papers? Oh, did you come here to paint? I remember now! Someone said you're a great artist. You paint a lot, right?\nIgnatz: Uh, yes. Yes. When I have time, that is. I enjoy painting. It helps me relax.\nLeonie: Ah! Well, that could be your thing.\nIgnatz: My... \"thing?\" Huh? What do you mean?\nLeonie: Last time we talked about it, you said you didn't have a thing you were really amazing at. But if you like painting so much, it must be a skill you're looking to master.\nIgnatz: M-my paintings are nothing but a hobby! Besides, I'm not that good. I never took art lessons. When... When I was little, I drew a picture for a young girl. The picture made her so happy that I decided to keep at it. That's how it started.\nLeonie: So, you're practicing your art to make other people happy? Is that it?\nIgnatz: Oh, no, that's an overstatement. I must insist, again, it's just a hobby. Even if I were to become a master artist, it wouldn't be a useful skill.\nLeonie: Aren't you from a merchant family employed by the nobles? I'd think it would be really useful there.\nIgnatz: I'm not inheriting the business. My brother is. My father said that I'm to become a knight. So my art won't do anyone any good. At all. Ever.\nLeonie: Oh, Ignatz..._Ignatz: Ah, Leonie. Off to train?\nLeonie: Already done. What about you? Off to draw?\nIgnatz: No, I'm on my way back. I was thinking of adding a little color to my latest piece, so...\nLeonie: Come to think of it, I've still never seen your work. Here, let me take a peek.\nIgnatz: It doesn't work like that! You have to let me know in advance. I need time to prepare.\nLeonie: Oh, lighten up!\n(Scene transition)\n\nLeonie: Wow! Look at all that paper! Are these all drawings? What should I look at first?\nIgnatz: Wherever we travel, I try to capture the feeling and character of the landscape. I guess they've all kind of piled up. Each place is unique, not just the geography, but also the clothing and the architecture and so on. Everywhere has its own design sensibilities.\nLeonie: Yeah. You'd think there'd be only one way to do stuff like engraving, but it actually varies a lot.\nIgnatz: Just within the Alliance, the styles are quite different between the north and south. And the Empire's even more diverse.\nLeonie: Oh, here's a landscape. What a bright blue sky! You really make it seem alive.\nIgnatz: The blue of the sky changes with the season too. In the summer, it's darker. And yet in the winter, it's almost luminous. And, of course, the landscape below affects the sky's appearance, by virtue of contrast. It's hard to get the color just right, so I spend a lot of time experimenting with pigments, and— oh no! I'm sorry. I've been talking your ear off.\nLeonie: Listen, Ignatz. You need to become a painter.\nIgnatz: Huh?\nLeonie: Don't say it's not useful. Your talent moves people. Someday, I'm sure your art will save someone's life.\nIgnatz: Oh, no, I wouldn't go nearly that far.\nLeonie: Remember that girl you told me about? You made her so happy. And you were only just starting out. Think about what you could do now that you've had so much practice! This is your calling.\nIgnatz: You think so?\nLeonie: Yeah! It's something you can do that no one else can. I envy you. I wish I had a gift like that. So stop apologizing for your talent and just do it!\nIgnatz: Thank you, Leonie. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot to think about._Leonie: Hey Ignatz! Drawing again?\nIgnatz: I am. I suppose that's rather irresponsible, as we're in the midst of a war. But ever since we last spoke, I've felt keen to pursue my artistic aspirations.\nLeonie: Like I said, it's your calling. Don't feel bad about it.\nIgnatz: All right, I'll try to embrace it! And you, are you practicing archery today?\nLeonie: More just double-checking this bowstring. I want to make sure it's ready for the next battle.\nIgnatz: Okay. Well, let's both do our best!\nLeonie: That's the spirit! Does that mean you've finally accepted that you're an artist?\nIgnatz: I'll try to discuss it with my parents after the war. There's little demand for knights in peacetime. In fact, painting might be a more reliable way for me to support my family. I'll try to persuade them with arguments along those lines.\nLeonie: Good point! I'm glad you've got some confidence.\nIgnatz: Come to think of it, Leonie, what will you do when the war is over?\nLeonie: Me? I'm going to become a top-tier mercenary.\nIgnatz: A mercenary in peacetime?\nLeonie: Even after the war's over, there'll be plenty of work for me to do before peace really takes hold. I'll pay what I owe my village back, with interest. After that, I don't know. Never thought about it.\nIgnatz: I'm sure you can do whatever you put your mind to.\nLeonie: Hardly. Lots of options just don't suit me. I mean, could you imagine me as a songstress? But yeah, I don't know. Once I've paid off my debts, I guess I'll just have to find something new.\nIgnatz: I don't think there's any rush. You can travel and relax and think about it.\nLeonie: Travel, huh? There's an idea. Wanna come with?\nIgnatz: Huh? Me?\nLeonie: Sure. You were really excited about different styles across the world, weren't you? Don't you want more of that? Maybe even see the sky in a new shade?\nIgnatz: Yes, I suppose I do. I'd like to see the whole world.\nLeonie: If your parents object, we'll just say I kidnapped you. Actually, feel free to say that, even if you go alone.\nIgnatz: Oh, no. I want us to see the world together. Your presence makes every landscape more beautiful.\nLeonie: Hey, hold on! What's this all of a sudden?\nIgnatz: Oh, uh, that's not what I meant!\nLeonie: Haha! You're hilarious, Ignatz. There's never a dull moment with you around._A+_null_
24_38_Ignatz: Phew, today's training was murder... Ah, Shamir! I have a question for you.\nShamir: …\nIgnatz: Um... Shamir?\nShamir: …\nIgnatz: Oh, I suppose she's meditating or something. Never mind then, I guess...\nShamir: Where are you going?\nIgnatz: Agh! Shamir?\nShamir: Don't you have a question?\nIgnatz: Uh, n-no! It's not important.\nShamir: I'm finished meditating. Speak.\nIgnatz: Ah, no, it's not... You're probably tired anyway.\nShamir: Always be willing to speak and ask questions. Understood?\nIgnatz: Y-yes, understood. I'll remember that for next time.\nShamir: Next time?\nIgnatz: Um, yes, I'm OK for today. Sorry to disturb you. I'll be leaving now.\n(Ignatz leaves)\n\nShamir: Why must he be so difficult?_Ignatz: Um, excuse me. Shamir?\nShamir: What is it? Do you need something?\nIgnatz: Yes. I was curious about the world beyond Fódlan.\nShamir: Oh.\nIgnatz: You came from somewhere outside Fódlan, right? I'm curious about your homeland, what kind of place it was, and I thought you might...\nShamir: I will not.\nIgnatz: Sorry?\nShamir: There's no point in me telling you about it.\nIgnatz: I, uh, I see. All right, then.\nShamir: Wait. You misunderstand. Hearing me tell stories about the things I've seen... What good is that? That's just my experience. If you want to know about the world, you need to experience it for yourself...is what I meant to say.\nIgnatz: Oh! That's what it was. That's...good.\nShamir: How so?\nIgnatz: I thought maybe you didn't like me.\nShamir: Is that what you think? In your experience, do I seem to dislike you? If you can't determine something as simple as that, then you would gain nothing from the outside world.\nIgnatz: Oh, um, I don't actually know! I'm not very good at reading people, I guess.\nShamir: Ask me. I'm right here.\nIgnatz: I... I'm not that brave. I'm sorry, I'll leave you alone! I'll be going now!\nShamir: Not brave enough to ask a simple question...or does he just not care?_Shamir: To put it plainly—no, I do not dislike you.\nIgnatz: Really? Oh, whew, I'm so glad I asked!\nShamir: Hm, so he does care... Why were you asking me about the world outside Fódlan before?\nIgnatz: There's so much I have yet to see. Even these days, when it's ravaged by conflict, the world is so diverse. Buildings and landscapes and geography differ vastly from place to place. There's so much variety within Fódlan, and the outside world must be even more varied! I feel so inspired just thinking about it. So I'd like to travel there some day.\nShamir: I see. You should go.\nIgnatz: You think so?\nShamir: I told you before. In order to know the world, you have to experience it for yourself. There is much to see. Even simple things. Flowers. Food. Varieties that don't exist in Fódlan. New smells. New tastes. I could tell you about them... But you would only imagine them, not comprehend them. If you want true understanding, go out into the world. See it with your eyes. Feel it with your skin... Speak to its people. Then you will know.\nIgnatz: Yes. Perhaps so...\nShamir: Is there something else?\nIgnatz: You've never talked to me like this before, Shamir.\nShamir: It's nothing.\nIgnatz: Ah, sorry... Hearing you talk about exploring the world made me think about what I should do with myself. Do you have plans for the future, after the war?\nShamir: Not yet. You're ahead of me there. I must find my own path.\nIgnatz: Ahead of you, Shamir? I highly doubt that.\nShamir: If you have time for empty compliments, you have time to encourage me instead.\nIgnatz: Yes, of course. Shamir, may you find success in everything you do!\nShamir: Thank you, Ignatz. I'll do my best._null_null_null_
