25_41_Ingrid: That's the third time this month. Well, that's that. Father never relents. Oh, Professor! Hello! Did you need something?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Were you just hiding something?\nChoice 2: What were you doing just now?\nIngrid: Well, um, that is... I was just tossing out something I have no need of. It's important to keep our spaces clean, after all! You'd do well to remember that too, Professor! A clean space makes for a clean mind...or some such. Getting rid of things you have no need for is the first step to managing one's belongings in an economical way.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Could you help tidy my room sometime?\nChoice 2: Are you the thrifty type?\nIngrid:\nChoice 1 Response: While I'd love to help, I don't want people getting the wrong idea with me being alone in your room.\nChoice 2 Response: Does that surprise you? Perhaps it seems ill befitting someone of noble birth to care about such things.\nIngrid: Despite my family's nobility, we've never been particularly wealthy. So my father raised me to be conservative with my resources, paring down when necessary. He also encouraged me to keep my living spaces immaculate, so the two go hand in hand, I suppose.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: He sounds like a good father.\nChoice 2: He sets a fine example I'd be happy to follow.\nIngrid:\nChoice 1 Response: Yes. He's...a good person. Even when managing our territory used up most of our family's resources, he still went out of his way to ensure my comfort.\nChoice 2 Response: I think he'd be happy to hear you say that.\nByleth: What was it you threw out, anyway?\nIngrid: Oh...just a scrap piece of paper. It was already written on, so no good for note-taking. And obviously I can't use it to clean my lance. So I tossed it. No need to hang on to inconsequential things, you know! Professor, did you come to check on me for any particular reason?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No particular reason, no.\nChoice 2: I just wanted to talk with you.\nIngrid: Ah. Well if there's nothing important, I'll be on my way, then. I still have some cleaning to take care of, after all. Talk to you later, Professor._Ingrid: Ugh, will Father never learn?! All of these useless letters are only creating more rubbish in the world! Professor? Ah, I didn't see you standing there. My apologies.\nByleth: Was that a letter you were disposing of?\nIngrid: Oh, ah... That paper? Well, I...yes. Yes, it was. It was a letter...from my father.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Are you sure you want to throw it away?\nChoice 2: Isn't that important to you?\nIngrid: I understand where you're coming from here, but I have no need of such things. It isn't like anything of importance was written on it. Curious? I suppose there's no harm in allowing you to read it. Go on, then.\nCount Galatea: My dearest daughter, Ingrid, are you well? I trust that you are behaving yourself and refraining from causing trouble for others. Things on the home front are in order. The marriage proposal for you and the viscount's son should be prepared soon. Although I am quite certain there are many superior candidates at Garreg Mach Monastery. As you know, the very survival of our family is dependent upon whom you marry. You are the only one left in the family who can make things right. We are all counting on you. Do not lose sight of what truly matters.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: This is...\nChoice 2: A letter about marriage prospects?\nIngrid: Yes. Perhaps you found it somewhat entertaining. I've told you that we've never been very well off, financially. My noble family - House Galatea - branched off from House Daphnel in the Alliance. Shortly after, we were lucky enough to receive the support of the royal family, allowing us to attain nobility...to some extent. But the territory we watch over is poor, its harvests meager. And our noble blood, too, has grown thin. Neither my father nor my brothers bear a Crest. I, however, do bear a Crest. Because of this, my father sees me as our family's one hope for the future. A Crest is highly prized among nobles. Were I to marry into a greater noble family, that financial support could soothe our woes...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I can't believe he would use you like that...\nChoice 2: What an awful way for him to treat you...\nIngrid: Thank you, Professor. Your sentiment alone is a great comfort to me. Despite my own feelings, I understand his approach to all this. It isn't that he doesn't care for me. I understand it very, very well. Which is why I...I apologize, Professor. I must be going._Ingrid: Apologies for bothering you so late. I just...really wanted to speak with you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm happy to listen.\nChoice 2: If you must.\nIngrid: Thank you. You see, I've been feeling conflicted. About my future. It may seem petty to worry about such things in the middle of a war like this...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I don't think it's petty.\nChoice 2: Let's hear it anyway.\nIngrid: This isn't something I open up about with many people. Feeling such a sense of inner turmoil while a war rages on and others are fighting with all they have, well... It feels a little selfish. The truth is, I've wanted to be a knight ever since I was a small child. Not just any knight, like one you might find serving within the castle guard, but a true knight - one serving a master. However, my father has always had different plans for me. He wants me to marry, for the benefit of the Galatea family.\nByleth: You don't have to do what you don't want to.\nIngrid: Defying my father feels...wrong. I've seen how he's struggled over the years. His burden has always been far greater than any I've had to bear myself. While he fed me extravagant meals, he subsisted on meager portions and watered-down soups... He never once complained - even though he must have been starving. Knowing his sacrifices, I've never been able to tell him of my dream of becoming a knight. Although ultimately, I find myself betraying his wishes. Now that I have parted ways with my father, there is nothing to stop me from pursuing my dream. But even if I do become a knight, I feel an unease deep within me. I fear I will never escape this guilt I carry. That I have shunned my duty as a noble.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sometimes there's no avoiding such complications.\nChoice 2: Could you not find a way to do both?\nChoice 3: It's no use worrying about things that are in the past. (only available when playing on Silver Snow, Crimson Flower, and/or Verdant Wind)\nIngrid:\nChoice 1 response: Yes. I know. All I can do is accept this inner turmoil.\nChoice 2 response: To follow both my dream and duty? I...I had never considered that as an option. Perhaps there is a way.\nChoice 3 response: Of course not. We cannot change what has already come to pass.\nIngrid: Even with the academy days long behind us, you're still a professor, through and through. Always listening to to hers' troubles and offering up your wisdom. I really am grateful for all that you do for us, Professor. I hope you'll always be here as a guide to everyone. I know I myself would appreciate that deeply..._null_null_Ingrid: Is something the matter? You seem lost in thought.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Just taking a little break.\nChoice 2: I was waiting for you.\nIngrid:\nChoice 1 response: I know you've been very busy lately. It's wise to take breaks and rest. Especially with all that is going on in the world...\nChoice 2 response: Oh? I didn't know... Though that is a bit of a coincidence. I came here in hopes of finding you. I had a feeling you might be here.\nIngrid: Actually, I...um... I wanted to speak with you about something. I-I promised myself I would wait until the war was over...\nByleth: What is it?\nIngrid: Well. Professor, I have feelings for you. Of course, I respect you as a person, and I'll understand if you can't love me back, but...still, I had to tell you. Though my focus has ever been on my duty and training, I cannot deny the feelings that have arisen. My dream is to obtain knighthood, but now I have a new dream to hold tight to... That is to be with you, always.\nByleth: ...\nIngrid: Um... I...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I have something for you.\nChoice 2: There's something I want as well.\nIngrid: Oh! Is this... I must say I'm a little...inelegant with such matters. Battle is all I know. Are you quite certain? You truly desire to share you life with me... I am so happy! I...I worried that my feelings would go unrequited. Now that all of that is out in the open, I feel as light as a feather! My love... I... I swear to stay by your side, always. I swear on the goddess above...and on you, here at my side. You and I, together, entering this new age. No matter what the future brings, I will stand by you, as your sword, your shield, and your dearest companion.\nIngrid: There is nothing that brings me more joy. It truly is all I need in this world.\nIngrid: I love you...so very much.\nIngrid: Ah, I'm sorry! I'm overcome. This may take some getting used to.

Just say when, and I'll be there in an instant!\nChoice 2 response: Does that surprise you? Perhaps it seems ill befitting of someone of noble birth to care about such things.\nIngrid: Despite my family's nobility, we've never been particularly wealthy.

25_39_Ingrid: ...\nSylvain: That was quite a sigh. What's wrong, Ingrid?\nIngrid: Tell me, Sylvain. What am I to you?\nSylvain: You're my friend...one of my oldest, in fact.\nIngrid: An old friend, is it? Then why must I clean up the casualties left behind by your... Your skirt chasing!\nSylvain: Heh, nobody asked you to do that. Heck, I thought you enjoyed it. Besides, you're real good at it. I'm excited to continue working with you.\nIngrid: Do you mean to imply you have no intention of acting a bit more respectably?\nSylvain: Please don't yell like that. Everybody's staring at us.\nIngrid: When you were eight, you came on to my sweet, sweet granny. My granny!\nSylvain: Come on. I was eight and she was gorgeo- That was a long time ago.\nStudent: Sylvain hit on Ingrid's grandmother? Wow...\nSylvain: People can hear you! Please be quiet.\nIngrid: When you were ten, we went to that harvest festival and you started making eyes at a scarecrow!\nStudent: A scarecrow?!\nSylvain: Wait a second. That was just an accident...a tragic, tragic accident.\nIngrid: When you were fifteen, you sought-relentlessly, might I add-to involve yourself with Lord Gwendal's daughter. Who do you suppose made peace with the furious lord, despite having nothing to do with it? Hm? Me. Always me, always for you. Every time.\nStudent: What a jerk...\nSylvain: You know what? This conversation is over. I'm done.\nIngrid: My point is this has to end. Not later, but now.\nSylvain: Fine, I promise I'll try to change. Are you happy now?_Ingrid: ...\nSylvain: That's a heavy sigh...again.\nIngrid: Yeah... That's the sigh of exhaustion after spending the past month apologizing for your behavior to, well, everyone.\nSylvain: Apologizing? I've been pretty darn restrained lately.\nIngrid: If by restrained you mean falling all over yourself to garner the attention of every passing female, then, yes, you've been restrained. Mark my words-the more you hurt people, the more weighty the repercussions will be. Your actions will come around to bite you.\nSylvain: Ha! If I get bitten, that's all just part of the game. Heck, I had one girl's brother come after me with a pitchfork. Heh heh...\nIngrid: If you end up getting maimed or killed by a pitchfork, don't expect me at your funeral. Glenn used to make light of getting hurt too. Then one day, he got more than hurt. Now he's gone.\nSylvain: I'm sorry. I was being... You're right. I know what it did to you when he died. It hurt to see you hurt and not be able to do anything. When you wouldn't even come out of your room to take care of your horse...\nIngrid: Nothing affected me the way his passing affected me.\nSylvain: Well, I'm happy that you're better. Seeing you out and about helped me relax enough to be able to flirt with girls again.\nIngrid: Your predictability is utterly disappointing. When I finally stopped mourning, you know what brought me back? My concern. For you.\nSylvain: Me?\nIngrid: You know you can't get along without me following in your shadow and caring for you. You flirt with anything that has a pulse, offend people left and right, and constantly cause commotion.\nSylvain: Huh... The truth really does hurt.\nIngrid: Please, Sylvain. Consider your actions before you carry them out. And stop acting so nonchalant about getting hurt or killed. Promise me that.\nSylvain: OK... I promise._Sylvain: Training on your own? You really do work hard.\nIngrid: I hate to break it to you, Sylvain, but there's nobody here for you to flirt with, so there's not much reason to hang around.\nSylvain: You're here, aren't you?\nIngrid: How ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as your face.\nSylvain: You'd really say something like that to a handsome guy like me? I'm crushed! Joking aside, may I join you? I only came out here so I could train too.\nIngrid: Sure. Just don't get in my way.\n(Screens fades to black briefly)\n\nSylvain: I've been thinking about it, and I really depend on you. Maybe that's weird since I'm older than you, but still...\nIngrid: Hitting on me? Again? Have some dignity, would you?\nSylvain: No! I'm being honest! I thought you'd listen. Hey, I'd like it if you didn't get too far away from me on the battlefield, OK? Just stay where I can see you.\nIngrid: I'll stay as long as I can. You're useless without me, after all.\nSylvain: What? No, I'm saying if there's one thing I can do on the battlefield, it's keep you safe.\nIngrid: Whatever helps you feel better. Stay and protect me, then. I couldn't bear it if you went off and died on me while I wasn't around.\nSylvain: Heh, I'm pretty sure that's my line.\n(Screen fades to black again)\n\nIngrid: It's getting late. We'd better head out.\nSylvain: You're right. I'm exhausted anyway.\nIngrid: You haven't been practicing enough. All that time you waste chasing after women would be better spent training. I'll train with you anytime. So just... Hm? What's that strange look for?\nSylvain: I just, uh... Well, you're going to think I'm being a jerk or hitting on you or whatever... When we're side by side like this, training, I feel-I don't know-oddly at ease.\nIngrid: I know what you mean. It's probably because we've been friends for so long.\nSylvain: That must be it. Let's never change. Friends forever?\nIngrid: Absolutely. No matter what happens, we'll always be friends, Sylvain._Sylvain: Hey, Ingrid. How are you\u2060— I mean, what are you\u2060— Are you... you know... off to train again?\nIngrid: No, I'm headed to town to buy supplies, but I'll be training after that, naturally. Why?\nSylvain: Oh, I just thought you look serious as ever. I guess that part of you hasn't changed.\nIngrid: Of course it hasn't. I am as I ever was.\nSylvain: Yeah, no... I mean, I guess you're right. Heh heh...\nIngrid: You're being weird. Have you always been this weird, and I just never noticed?\nSylvain: No. I'm pretty sure. I don't think so. By the by, have you, ya know, fallen for anybody recently?\nIngrid: Don't be ridiculous. What are you even bumbling on about?\nSylvain: Well everyone's been talking about how you got really, uh, pretty. Just, you know, all of a sudden.\nIngrid: Oh, you must be referring to the makeup. It's not a big deal or anything. Just experimenting. I'm still learning. Did I mess something up?\nSylvain: Huh? No, I... I think it looks good. You did surprisingly well. I mean, considering that it's you.\nIngrid: Very funny. But I must say, I'm a bit surprised. It's unlike you to stumble over yourself this much.\nSylvain: What? No, I'm not! I'm just, ya know, curious about why... all of a sudden.\nIngrid: Why what? Why I'm wearing makeup?\nSylvain: I'm still guessing it's for a guy. If I had to try and guess what sort of guy, I suppose I'd say...\n(Azure Moon only) Sylvain: Felix? No, wait, I'm forgetting the royal line. Dimitri would be a way better catch.\nIngrid: Wow. Way to make assumptions.\nSylvain: Is it one of the knights? If it's not them... Wait. Could it be me?!\nIngrid: Don't make me hurt you.\nSylvain: No need for violence. It was just a joke! Um, I mean... It's not a joke that you're beautiful, but I wasn't trying to hit on you or anything. Promise.\nIngrid: Beautiful, huh?_A+_null_
25_33_Ingrid: Nightfall already? Suppose I'd better wrap up...\nMercedes: Good work with your training today, Ingrid. Here's something to wipe up the sweat.\nIngrid: Whoa, Mercedes? Hi? Hello. How long have you been, um- Thank you!\nMercedes: You're very welcome! I've been here since you started.\nIngrid: That long? Huh. Well, my apologies for not having noticed you. I get so caught up in training, you know. But why are you here? I can't imagine it was too terribly interesting watching me.\nMercedes: I disagree. I just couldn't help but admire your training technique. I have to say, you were very impressive. I'm nowhere near as graceful as you.\nIngrid: Graceful? I wouldn't say that, but thank you. If I'm to be honest, I'm the one who admires you.\nMercedes: Goodness! Me? How so?\nIngrid: You're always so put together- you hold yourself with such poise and have such a keen eye for fashion. I mean, even the handkerchief you handed me smells like...lavender, is it? It's just lovely.\nMercedes: That perfume is a favorite of mine. I'm so glad you like it.\nIngrid: Even the fact that you thought to put perfume on your handkerchief is delightfully foreign to me. I'd never have thought of that.\nMercedes: I'll gladly share some with you. You're welcome to come visit my room whenever you'd like. We can have tea and chat! How does that sound?\nIngrid: Ah, that sounds really nice, yes. Sipping tea and having a chat- it's unlike me, but it sounds lovely.\nMercedes: From now on, we'll meet up whenever we have time. We can go right now if you're free?\nIngrid: Oh, no need to trouble yourself and rearrange things for me.\nMercedes: It's no trouble at all! You'll never know if you're the type who enjoys chatting over tea if you never try.\nIngrid: Hehe! All right, then!_Ingrid: Apologies for my late arrival, Mercedes. My duties ran long, as per usual.\nMercedes: There's no need to apologize at all! Please, have a seat.\n(They both sit)\n\nMercedes: We've met for tea so many times, but you never seem to get used to it, do you, Ingrid?\nIngrid: Not entirely, no. I'm not accustomed to being treated so...delicately. Anyway, what will we talk about today?\nMercedes: I actually wanted to gripe about something that's been bothering me.\nIngrid: You? Gripe? Now that's unusual! I'm happy to listen, of course. It's the least I can do after all the kindness you've shown me.\nMercedes: Thank you. The one thing I really wanted to talk about is marriage...\nIngrid: Oh?\nMercedes: Yes. I received a letter from my adoptive father about marriage discussions with a noble family.\nIngrid: And will you accept?\nMercedes: That's the problem. No matter what I decide, I'll probably be married off anyway. What I really want to do is help those in need. But I think it would be more difficult to do so if I married a nobleman.\nIngrid: Understandably so. Sounds to me like you need a strategy to silence your father.\nMercedes: Sorry? To...silence him? (laughs) We don't need to go that far. I'm sorry, I really just needed to let that out. I don't need you to worry about solving my problems.\nIngrid: Oh. OK. It's...just a bit personal for me, actually. My own father has brought countless marriage proposals to my attention. He always was obsessed with me carrying on the family bloodline. At a very young age, my hand had already been promised to someone in marriage. But Glenn died young.\nMercedes: That must have been difficult for you. Would you have married him if he had survived?\nIngrid: Hm. That's a good question. It's hard to imagine now. Although I did admire him quite a lot. He held true to the ideals of knighthood, proudly serving the king. Even after all these years, I aspire to be the type of knight that he embodied. But that's just it. I'm not a tool for furthering my family's fortunes. I'm a knight at heart. Regardless of what my father desires.\nMercedes: I see. A very noble cause indeed. How strange that we should be worrying about the same thing.\nIngrid: Even though we are such different people.\nMercedes: It's true. Enjoying a nice chat over tea with you like this makes me realize... Maybe the paths we walk aren't so different after all. Don't you think?\nIngrid: I do. These tea parties of ours...they really are something special.\nMercedes: That they are, Ingrid... I would love to get to know you better, if that's OK. I want to know about your childhood , your favorite books, the sweets you like, anything at all!\nIngrid: Hahaha, absolutely! I'm happy to speak with you anytime, and I want to know you better too, Mercedes._null_null_null_null_
25_35_Raphael: Mmm...this meat is so good! I wish I could send some home to my little sis.\nIngrid: Raphael, what are you doing here?\nRaphael: Oh! I was just enjoying some of this roast! Did you want a bite?\nIngrid: No, no. I meant what are you doing here? This isn't the dining hall.\nRaphael: Hahaha! That's funny. Of course I know this isn't the dining hall!\nIngrid: You know that, and yet you're stuffing your face here, rather than where it's appropriate. You're not even seated!\nRaphael: Is that the best way to eat? If you think so, let's sit down!\nIngrid: Argh! You're missing the point! At least use a plate!\nRaphael: I don't have a plate with me, so there's nothing I can do about that now. But since when are you so proper, Ingrid?\nIngrid: I'm not proper at all! You're just downright crude. Have you no respect for yourself and your journey to knighthood? Knights must work from a very young age to be upstanding in all facets. You are making a mockery of all that we stand for! You-\nRaphael: Slow down! I can't do all this listening while I'm trying to eat!\nIngrid: Disgusting! Now you've spilled gravy all over your shoes and your chin! You'd better wipe that up.\nRaphael: Now you need everything to be neat and tidy? You're really particular.\nIngrid: This has nothing to do with me. It's what's expected of a knight!\nRaphael: Wait. All I have to do is be neat and tidy and I can become a knight? Forget all that studying then, I'm just gonna work on being the neatest and tidiest one here!\nIngrid: I - Wait. Th-that is not what I said!\nRaphael: Ugh. Really? You're probably right. I shouldn't bother with the neat and tidy stuff.\nIngrid: You are impossible!_Raphael: Huh? Is that Ingrid? I'd better get outta here before she scolds me again.\nRaphael: Actually...she looks kinda sad. Maybe I shouldn't run away...Hey! Ingrid! Why do you look so sad? Are you hungry or something?\nIngrid: Oh. It's you. No, I'm not hungry.\nRaphael: You're not hungry...but you're sad anyway? I don't get it. Are you sick?\nIngrid: No.\nRaphael: Then are you sure you're not hungry?\nIngrid: I just told you that wasn't it. It's nothing you can help with, anyway.\nRaphael: Well, sometimes you gotta talk it out. That's what my grandpa says.\nIngrid: Yeah, I guess that's helpful sometimes. Are you willing to listen, then?\nRaphael: Of course! Please, go ahead.\nIngrid: I've just received yet another letter from my father regarding a marriage arrangement with a noble family.\nRaphael: I see. I see.\nIngrid: I am the only person in House Galatea capable of carrying on our family line...of passing on a Crest...\nRaphael: Ahhh, I see. I see.\nIngrid: I've long understood that it would be expected of me to marry, of course.\nRaphael: Hmmm...I see. I see.\nIngrid: Raphael, are you even listening?\nRaphael: I'm right there with you, but-\n(Raphael's stomach gurgles)\n\nIngrid: Did you hear that ominous sound? Was that...thunder?\nRaphael: Sorry. All that listening made me hungry! After hearing you out, I think you're probably just hungry too, and your troubles are sure to go away after a good meal!\nIngrid: I really am not hungry, but I can't say no to good food.\nIngrid: All right, let's just eat, then. I can tell you about my struggles some other time, maybe._Ingrid: Eating? In the dining hall? You?!\nRaphael: Whaddaya mean? The dining hall's where I do most of my eating.\nIngrid: If only the old version of you could hear you say that. It seems to me you've taken more care with your appearance of late too. For once, you aren't covered in gravy and oil from head to toe. I'm impressed!\nRaphael: Of course not, Ingrid. A proper knight has to be neat and tidy.\nIngrid: All right, what have you done with Raphael?\nRaphael: It's all thanks to you. You said I had to clean up if I wanted to be a knight, so I started being more careful. Do you think I have what it takes now?\nIngrid: You've certainly become more knightly than before. But there's plenty yet to do to become a proper knight. It's not as simple as eating where you're meant to and not being covered in gravy.\nRaphael: Maybe I'd have a better chance if I just married you!\nIngrid: Uh... What does that have to do with anything?\nRaphael: You're real cultured, that's all. You already taught me to be neat and tidy. I figure you could teach me lot more about being a proper knight if I always had you around!\nIngrid: That woul be quite the undertaking for me. Listen, Raphael...that's sweet of you. However, as I've said before, I've no intention to marry. Let's cast aside this talk of marriage and instead embolden one another to be the best knights we can be!\nRaphael: You're right. Probably a better idea to just embolden each other instead. As long as I still get your help with becoming a proper knight!\nIngrid: While you're working to be more proper, I'll be working to strengthen myself, that I might become a greater knight than you!\nRaphael: Huh? I don't know about that. I'm pretty tough. But I guess if anyone can beat me, it'd probably be you, Ingrid! Guaranteed!\nIngrid: Thank you, Raphael. That means a lot to me._null_null_null_
25_37_Ingrid: ...\nSeteth: Is something bothering you, Ingrid?\nIngrid: Oh! Seteth! You seem to have caught me when I thought nobody was around.\nSeteth: Perhaps I can help, if you would like to share.\nIngrid: I wouldn’t want to bother you with my trivialities.\nSeteth: I will not pry, of course. But if you keep it to yourself, no one will be able to help you.\nIngrid: That’s true. It’s regarding my father.\nSeteth: Count Galatea? I have met him, once or twice.\nAzure Moon\nIngrid: Well. you have likely heard that House Galatea’s financial situation is precarious. Many regions of Faerghus are harsh and infertile, but our lands especially so. There were several years of fruitless harvests— it nearly ruined us. We could barely feed our troops. Then I was born bearing a Crest, after generations bore none. Suddenly my family hung its future on me. My father had hopes that with my Crest, I’d be married into a noble family and that House Galatea’s financial troubles would be a thing of the past.\nSeteth: Ah, I see. And the other house would benefit from the addition of your Crest-bearing blood. It seems to me you have suffered much for the misfortune of being born with a Crest.\nIngrid: I beg your pardon?\nSeteth: I know Crests are highly valued, but they are also a burden. My feelings are mixed.\nIngrid: You truly think so? But you’re so devoted to the goddess. I’m surprised to hear you say such a thing.\nSeteth: Perhaps one day I will expound upon my opinion of Crests in greater detail to you. For now, let it suffice to say that whether or not you bear one is secondary to your identity. You are a person, first and foremost. And you should be permitted to grow as a person, Crest or not.\nIngrid: I agree. Thank you for listening.\nSeteth: If you ever wish to discuss this again, consider me available whenever you please.\nIngrid: Thank you so much!\nVerdant Wind/Silver Snow\nIngrid: Yes, that's him. He and I have parted ways now. House Galatea was financially unstable for a long time. We were hardly able to support our soldiers and their steeds... My father had hopes that with my Crest, I'd be married into a noble family and that House Galatea's financial troubles would be a thing of the past.\nSeteth: Ah, I see. And the other house would benefit from the addition of your Crest-bearing blood.\nIngrid: That was certainly the idea. But I broke ties with them. I do wonder how they are doing back home...\nSeteth: It seems to me you have suffered much for the misfortune of being born with a Crest.\nIngrid: I beg your pardon?\nSeteth: I know Crests are highly valued, but they are also a burden. My feelings are mixed.\nIngrid: You truly think so? But you’re so devoted to the goddess. I’m surprised to hear you say such a thing.\nSeteth: Perhaps one day I will expound upon my opinion of Crests in greater detail with you. For now, let it suffice to say that whether or not you bear one is secondary to your identity. You are a person, first and foremost. And you should be permitted to grow as a person, Crest or not.\nIngrid: I agree. Thank you for listening.\nSeteth: If you ever wish to discuss this again, consider me available whenever you please.\nIngrid: Thank you so much!_Seteth: Ingrid. Are you familiar with the story of the King of Liberation, and the 10 Elites of Fódlan?\nIngrid: Of course! They were the heroes who struck down evil with the power of the sacred weapons, protecting our land and people. Their strength was passed down through the ages, manifesting itself in the Crests some of us are born with.\nSeteth: Yes. The 10 Elites certainly possessed great power. But does that make them worthy of worship?\nIngrid: I imagine you ask because they later fought amongst themselves, turning on one another, ravaging the land.\nSeteth: Precisely. Initially, Nemesis and the 10 Elites worked together to bring peace to Fódlan. But soon their ambitions got the best of them, and they clashed, using their sacred weapons on anyone they chose, strong and weak alike. What I mean to say is, possessing strength alone does not make one worthy of respect. Rather, one should be judged by how they choose to use that strength.\nIngrid: Yes, I agree.\nSeteth: If you follow that logic, then you will see it also applies to those who are born with Crests. Now, think of how your father wishes to wed you to another family's fortune on the basis of your Crest.\nIngrid: Yes? What of it?\nSeteth: These are purely inherited qualities. Is it not foolish to judge a person's value by some inherited fortune? That is all a Crest is, really.\nIngrid: That's what I think too. Having a Crest or not has no bearing on your worth as a person.\nSeteth: I understand that Count Galatea believes he has the right to manage your affairs. I am certain he has his own share of problems. And I do not wish to meddle or lay blame. But if there is anything I should like to say to his daughter, it is this. How you live your life is up to you.\nIngrid: Thank you for your counsel and wisdom, Seteth. I've been thinking a lot lately about what might happen after the war. Father's hopes were dashed long ago... I will take some time to reflect on what lies ahead—my future._Ingrid: ...\nSeteth: Still contemplating, I see.\nIngrid: Without so much as a word, you've read me through and through.Since last we spoke, I've been thinking a lot about my future. How I want to spend my life. It's a lot to think about, and I haven't entirely sorted out where I'm going. I think I need more time to grow.\nSeteth: On the contrary, you have given this honest and sincere thought. I am quite impressed, actually.\nIngrid: You're impressed with me?\nSeteth: Worry about the future is not unique to youth. It is human nature. At the risk of being overbearing, might I offer you one more piece of advice?\nIngrid: Of course.\nSeteth: Have you considered what your life would be like had you not been born with a Crest?\nIngrid: Hmm...\nSeteth: Do you suppose that you would have been ordinary? Insignificant? I do not think so. Even without a Crest, such a promising young lady as yourself would have a bright future ahead of her.\nIngrid: Seteth, I...\nSeteth: I am not typically inclined to flattery, so I hope you will take my words to heart. Have faith in yourself. If you trade that faith for a misplaced pride in your Crest, I will have to reassess your character.\nIngrid: I've no intention of doing such a thing. It will take me time and experience, but I will find my path and walk it proudly.\nSeteth: I am glad to hear it, Ingrid._(Note: this conversation can only be viewed when on the Azure Moon route)\n\nIngrid: Seteth! Do you have a moment?\nSeteth: Certainly. Have you arrived at a decision about what you would like your future to be?\nIngrid: I think so. I was hoping I might ask for your opinion on the subject.\nSeteth: I am flattered. Please proceed.\nIngrid: I want to serve as a knight and protect my homeland. I know this, through and through. It has been my truth for as long as I can remember. However, I feel that I should choose a path that would benefit my father. I was raised by him in a happy home, never wanting for anything, despite my family's meager finances. I owe it to him to choose a path he'd approve of.\nSeteth: If that is the decision you have reached after such careful deliberation, then I have no objections. But may I ask you something?\nIngrid: Please, go ahead.\nSeteth: Have you actually had a conversation with your father about this?\nIngrid: I have not. There hasn't been time to pay him a visit. He did permit me to join this war... But I was brash about my departure. I...I left forcibly.\nSeteth: In that case, it is all the more important that you speak to him.\nIngrid: Perhaps. My father is an obstinate man. At this point, I'm not sure he'd care to hear what I have to say.\nSeteth: I do not know the man well, so perhaps it is not my place to judge. However, I do know what it is like to fret constantly over one's family. If he is as doting a father as you say, then he will want to know how you truly feel. I do not think he will refuse your wishes if you share them with him honestly. Of course, if your decision remains the same after speaking with him, then so be it.\nIngrid: Seteth... Thank you. You're right. I should talk to him. I've spent so much time thinking about how stubborn he is that I've neglected to acknowledge my own part in all this. Rather than blaming him, I need to recognize how stubborn I myself have been. Maybe if I open up and allow for vulnerability, he will too...\nSeteth: That is the way! Hold your head up high, and stride forward into the unknown!\nIngrid: I will! And I will keep your words close to my heart. Thank you for everything, Seteth._A+_null_
25_40_Ingrid: Mmm! Yes, it's decided. This meat is the best meat! Although, the other inn has pretty great offerings, as well...\nYuri: Ah, if it isn't Ingrid. What are you up to in a place like this?\nIngrid: ... Yuri! I could ask you the same...\nYuri: I'm just out to send a little money to my family. Gotta help however I can, you know?\nIngrid: Aww... That's very nice of you. Forgive my tone earlier. You truly set a noble example.\nYuri: Right, right. Anyhow, looked like I interrupted you. You nearly choked on that wad of meat you were gnawing on.\nIngrid: Uh, right. That...that is true, I suppose. Hmm... You know... I... Um...\nYuri: What is it you're mumbling about?\nIngrid: Anyway, you once worked for House Rowe, didn't you? Four years ago, when I visited Count Rowe at his castle, I swore saw you by his side...\nYuri: Quite the sharp memory you have. You aren't mistaken. I was staying there then, yes. I had been adopted by the count.\nIngrid: Oh? Come to think of it, I thought I'd heard something like that. That the count had adopted a distant relative of his, a young man whose future was both bright and promising. So...that was you?\nYuri: Yep. Although now I'm nothing ore than a distant stranger to him. Our ties were severed a while ago. He helped me out by getting me into the academy. It wasn't long after that that we started having all sorts of...disagreements. What the hell were you doing visiting House Rowe, anyhow?\nIngrid: Ah, yes...that. How to put it. It was to help...clean up after a friend.\nYuri: Ah, you speak of Sylvain. Mm-hmm, that must've been quite the mess you were cleaning up. Back to the point—what are you doing out here? Do you frequent this area often?\nIngrid: Mind your business, won't you? I just like to go for walks—get fresh air. That sort of thing.\nYuri: Easy now. I'm not interrogating you. Really, I just wanted to warn you that it isn't so safe here in the evenings. You'll want to be on your guard.\nIngrid: I thank you for your concern, but I assure you I can handle myself.\nYuri: Noted. Oh yeah, the innkeeper also wanted me to thank you.\nIngrid: Hm?\nYuri: He wanted to thank you for being such an enthusiast for the food he sells. Seemed pretty happy about it.\nIngrid: Is that so? How very... Hm. Well, I'd better be off!\nYuri: Seems she doesn't want anyone seeing her with a face full of food. Too late._Ingrid: So, what is it, Yuri? You had me come all this way.\nYuri: I need you for something. Have a seat. I won't take much of your time.\nIngrid: Okaaay...\nYuri: My apologies for keeping you waiting. Here you are!\nIngrid: Oh, wow! Did you...make this yourself?\nYuri: I may not seem like much of a chef, but I know a thing or two about cooking. Look tasty, hm?\nIngrid: Can I, uh...eat it now? I'm famished after all the training.\nYuri: Have at! That's why I asked you here.\nIngrid: I see! Well, thank you! Don't mind if I do! Mmm, this dish is divine! The first bite just melts in your mouth, and these vegetables are perfect! The flavors are interwoven together like...like a dance of swords between two Myrmidons!\nYuri: Heh heh! Calm yourself, Ingrid. I'm in no need of a critique. I just want you to enjoy it and take a load off.\nIngrid: Aww, thank you! I will! Whew! That was delicious, Yuri. I cannot thank you enough.\nYuri: I'm glad. Then it was well worth all the toil that went into preparing it.\nIngrid: You...haven't eaten anything for yourself?\nYuri: I figured I'd eat something a bit later. I didn't make the meal for me.\nIngrid: You cooked only for me?\nYuri: Mm-hm. The innkeeper provided me with some of his finest meat and told me to feed you. I figured if I was going to do it, I'd better do it right. So, I popped into the kitchen and got working.\nIngrid: That won't do at all, Yuri. Meals are meant to be shared. It seems my stomach got the better of me this time, though, and I scarfed everything before remembering that.\nYuri: Why bother yourself with such trivialities? The meal was a gift. Seeing you enjoy yourself like that is all the reward I need.\nIngrid: What way is that...\nYuri: A bit like when you had all that meat stuffed into your cheeks at the marketplace...like some kind of chipmunk. Hm-mm! I like seeing the contentment on your face when you cut loose.\nIngrid: You do?\nYuri: The innkeeper couldn't have said it better. ''She's got a real foodie face, that one!''\nIngrid: I'm not quite sure how to feel...\nYuri: Heh, really though! There are few things I enjoy as much as seeing a woman indulging herself.\nIngrid: ... You should consider your words before using them. Such a flirtatious comment can only invite misunderstandings.\nYuri: I didn't mean it that way!_Ingrid: Finally, you've arrived! I was beginning to get impatient. Have a seat.\nYuri: What are you on about?\nIngrid: I'm not on about anything. Let's have dinner together, Yuri.\nYuri: ...What is this? Did you make it?\nIngrid: I did. It's a simple dish—my culinary skills are fairly basic.\nYuri: Hold on. What exactly is this about?\nIngrid: You cook for me, I cook for you. That's how this works. It may not be quite as elegant a meal as that of Adrestian or Leicester cuisine... But the food of Faerghus is delicious nonetheless.\nYuri: Thank you for the meal. It was lovely, Ingrid. The flavors were... nostalgic. Reminded me of when I lived with my mother and the elder. I was actually born in a poor town in Faerghus. The flavors in this dish remind me of those days. Eh, sorry. I didn't mean to compare a meal made by nobility with the meager food I grew up eating.\nIngrid: No offense taken. To tell the truth, although my house is a noble one, it's also lacking in money. Our territory was struck by famine, and we ate whatever the land gave us... which wasn't much. We took what we could, just like everyone.\nYuri: I see... Well, I must say that your cooking is quite to my taste. Any meal made with so much thought and care is bound to be delicious.\nIngrid: Heh heh! Why, thank you! High praise, indeed, from someone who knows their way around a kitchen.\nYuri: To survive in this world means to sharpen many skills. Whether it's cooking or anything else, really. Although, I've got to say, I do enjoy cooking. And if my meals can bring a smile to someone's face, all the better. Celebrating victories with friends, sitting around a table with loved ones, watching someone enjoy the meal I made them... Few things bring me more joy.\nIngrid: Have you ever considered giving up being the lord of the underworld and becoming a chef instead?\nYuri: Heh... A chef, huh? You know, that doesn't sound half bad.\nIngrid: If you ever do, I'd come to your restaurant and eat whatever you'd whipped up every day!\nYuri: I'd like that very much. I'd work extra hard so I could see that lovely smile of yours.\nIngrid: You are just too much! I can hardly maintain my composure around you...\nYuri: Did I say something wrong?\nIngrid: Not at all, Yuri. Not at all._null_null_null_
