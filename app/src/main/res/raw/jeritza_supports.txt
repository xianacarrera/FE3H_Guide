Not hungry?\nByleth: What... is that...\n(Image: Sorbet)\n\nJeritza: I am partaking in some sweet delights. Is there a problem?\nByleth:\nThat's unexpected.\nYou... have a sweet tooth?\nJeritza: Yes...\nJeritza: I am a person too... What I eat is nobody's business but my own. If you need something, spit it out. My ice cream is melting.\nByleth:\nI don't need anything.\nJeritza: Then leave.\nI came to see if you'd join me for training.\nJeritza: Perhaps after I finish devouring this treat.\nJeritza: ...\nByleth: Are you really the Death Knight?\nJeritza: I am. And I am not. At the moment, I am Jeritza von Hrym. The emperor and the army know me only as the Death Knight... But he is merely an illusion—a demon who resides in my heart. He is not me. Not who I am at my core. He thrives and feasts upon blood, death, suffering... So while I sit here eating, I prefer to just be myself. Jeritza. I would like to be who I truly am. ...\nByleth: ...\nJeritza: I am incapable of enjoying my dessert with you gawking at me like that. I have no further words for you. Go.\n(Byleth nods)\n\nByleth: (Wow... he likes ice cream...)_(Location: Entrance Hall)\n\nImperial Soldier: Lord Jeritza? I believe he used to be a professor at the Officers Academy. It was also my understanding that he was personally recommended by Lord Arundel himself, landing him a position as a sword instructor.\n(Location: Knights' Hall)\n\nImperial Soldier: Whatever the case is, behind that mask of death, there is an emptiness... A void... This is probably just a rumor, but I heard he was found and taken in by Her Majesty herself... Supposedly he's the heir of the Hrym family, but I also heard he's only a distant relative who was adopted. He sure is mysterious...\n(Location: Dining Hall)\n\nJeritza: You've been asking around about me.\nByleth:\nI have.\nI have not.\nJeritza: It matters not to me, one way or the other. Do you want to know of my past?\nByleth:\nI do.\nJeritza: Why?\nI don't.\nJeritza: Then why bother asking around?\nJeritza: Friend or foe. That's what you're trying to determine. But you won't find answers merely with words. There is only one path forward. Raise your sword, if you have the nerve. Raise it and fight me. If you want to know my heart, know my sword.\nByleth:\nI must fight you?\nJeritza: It's only to spar. Nobody will be slain.\nI'm not a fan of bloodshed.\nJeritza: I cannot kill you yet. The Death Knight knows that very well. I've been told to refrain from killing you until the war has ended.\nByleth:\nBy whom?\nJeritza: The emperor.\nTell me more.\nJeritza: I came to an understanding with the emperor herself and agreed to do her bidding.\nJeritza: The young emperor discovered me, long ago... Though, back then, she was still a princess. Ultimately, it was she who erased my past. She placed me into a family that was disintegrating, that I might be their heir.\nByleth:\nYour past, you say?\nJeritza: Indeed. My past. My crimes for killing a useless man and his kin.\nSo it was Edelgard...\nJeritza: To survive, the Death Knight must spill blood. Left to his own devices, he would kill innocent passersby. Through the emperor's grace, he was allowed hunting grounds. That is why, to this day, I follow her. I am not yet ready to yield such fertile hunting grounds. Nor am I ready to truly fight you... Of course, were I not here to hold him back, he would cut you down without hesitation. As for me, I, too... Never mind. If you've no intention of fighting, then be gone. Perhaps it is he who is to blame, but I... I feel... oddly when I look at you..._(Location: Training Grounds)\n\nJeritza: The way your sword glides through the air... I am in awe... You...paired with that sword... It may bring about my end.\nByleth:\nI would never kill an ally.\nJeritza: So weak. That weakness will be your end.\nDo you want to die?\nJeritza: I...I do not know. Perhaps I do.\nJeritza: Long ago...when the Death Knight saw you in the Holy Mausoleum, I came to an understanding. That it is you, and you alone, who are capable of slaying me. Only you, with your sword, can do it. Upon reflection, I can see that our encounter was fated to happen. Ever since then, I've been thinking...\nByleth:\nWhy was I chosen?\nJeritza: Why, indeed? Why was the Death Knight fixated so fervently upon you?\nThat there are others stronger than me?\nJeritza: Perhaps that is so.\nJeritza: At that moment, he fell under your spell. You who wields the Sword of the Creator. And now, as I fight alongside you, I too fall victim to your spell. That I am unable to fight you is truly regrettable.\nByleth:\nShould we fight? Here and now?\nJeritza: Now is not the time.\nFirst we must end this war.\nJeritza: Yes,I suppose that is true. This futile, pointless war. Let us end it quickly.\nJeritza: Uniting Fódlan and overthrowing the church are mere trivialities to me. All I truly need is you... You, and nothing else.\nByleth:\nI... It feels like you like me...\nJeritza: Perhaps that is true, viewed in a certain light.\nThat sounds very nice...\nJeritza: It does. In the meantime, continue to strengthen your swordplay.\nJeritza: And please don't get yourself killed by some foolish brigands. You must live, that we might fight one another to the death. I must know which one of us will emerge victorious. For now, I will have to use my imagination and savor the potential outcomes of that future. I can see it now. You, swiftly dodging my blade, and then at last, your sword piercing my flesh. I stumble to the ground, gasping for air, breathing my last. Or perhaps... Perhaps my blade will pierce you first.\nByleth: Do you...really want to keep going with this?\nJeritza: No. That is enough. I must refrain from such fantasies—they make my urge to slay you all the stronger. It is enough to stand by your side while I await that day of true pleasure.\nByleth:\nI am counting on you.\nI look forward to fighting you.\nJeritza: Indeed. You and I are fated to be intertwined. I will follow you to the very gates of hell._null_null_(Location: Shambhala)\n\nJeritza: Huh! Hyah!\n(Jeritza attacks)\n\nAgarthan Soldier: Hya!\nJeritza: Utterly boring. These kills are worth less than nothing to me. Are you done? Let's move on already.\n(Byleth nods)\n\nJeritza: The war has ended, and yet this incessant swatting at flies never ceases. I have yet to claim my moment to kill you, it seems.\nByleth:\nWe will settle this.\nJeritza: Yes, we will. It is all that I live for now.\nYou won't be killing me.\nJeritza: Ah, or will I? The clash of spirits fighting for their lives—battle is the one thing that puts blood in my veins.\nJeritza: Funny, is it not? That we should fight toward the same end, only to vanquish one another in time.\nByleth:\nIt's rare to see you smile.\nJeritza: I do not quite know how to articulate these curious feelings... I think it could be described as... contentment? Perhaps it stems from discovering such a creature as you...\nYou find it funny?\nJeritza: Perhaps funny was a poor word choice. Happy. Content. Yes, those are better words.\nJeritza: All this time, I had determined it was the Death Knight who was drawn to you... Yet, fighting alongside you, I have come to realize that you are the only being who truly means anything to me. Once we exterminate the rats lurking below ground, and all of this madness is settled... Once that finally happens, all of this will long be forgotten. And we shall indulge in the finer things. Together.\nByleth:\nI look forward to it.\nUntil that day comes, you must survive.\nJeritza: Indeed. I abandoned all that I am. My true name, whatever remnants were left of my past... But now, with the chance to fight you... It is my only reason for existing. I finally understand. It is you alone who can slay the demon that lives inside of me... The Death Knight... This strange feeling rising up within me... Is this what is called...love?\nByleth:\nIt may be.\nI feel the same way.\nJeritza: That... pleases me. Let us away, then. Beyond these shadows that we have dwelt in for so long. To the very depths of hell, I will tumble down with you.

26_33_(Location: Mercedes' Room)\n\nMercedes: I never imagined I'd see you again.\nJeritza: Indeed...\nMercedes: Emile, I've missed you so much. How long has it been since we last spoke?\nJeritza: Since you left House Bartels. I was eight.\nMercedes: And just look at you now! All grown up. I notice that you still indulge in sweets. It makes me happy to see that you're still the same in some ways.\nJeritza: Hm... It has been some time since I've tasted such a thing...\nMercedes: Well, of course. That's because this is a recipe only mother and I know of. ... Oh no! You've gotten crumbs all over your face! Sit still while I wipe them off.\nJeritza: Stop it.\nMercedes: Oh, come on. Allow me to be your big sis. It won't hurt you to indulge me.\nJeritza: Mercedes. The little brother you once loved... He is no longer here.\nMercedes: It doesn't matter to me how you've changed. You will always be my baby brother. You are precious to both me and to Mother.\nJeritza: Mother is well, I assume...\nMercedes: She is very well! You should send her a letter. She'd be so thrilled.\nJeritza: I suppose...\nMercedes: Mother has always borne a deep regret over what happened. We should have brought you with us... We never intended to leave you with House Bartels.\nJeritza: Perhaps not. But it was wise of Mother to have only taken you. As the heir, if she had taken me, Father would have searched relentlessly for us all. And... had he found us... I feel certain he'd have killed you both.\nMercedes: Yes... That's what Mother said, too. He'd have done exactly that. You know, I've heard about what happened... About killing the family of House Bartels.\nJeritza: And? Are you afraid of me? Or... do you despise me?\nMercedes: Neither of those. That isn't why I brought this up. I understand your reasons, but it's a terrible thing to take a life. You understood that even then. I've been waiting a very long time to ask you. Why did you do it? Why did you kill your father?\nJeritza: Because I wanted to.\nMercedes: I know you're avoiding my question. I can hear it in your voice. I won't ask any further if you don't want to tell me why. But... just let me know if you ever feel ready to talk about it.\nJeritza: Understood. The time may eventually come.\nMercedes: Until then, I'll wait patiently._(Location: Dormitory)\n\nMercedes: Hello, Emile. The war council is about to begin -- come on!\nJeritza: ...\nMercedes: What's the matter? You're so pale... Have you been injured?\nJeritza: ...\nMercedes: Emile?\n(Jeritza attacks Mercedes)\n\nMercedes: Ah!\nJeritza: Must... slay... more...\nMercedes: What?\nJeritza: There is no pleasure to be had in these halls... My thirst is unbearable... Perhaps bathing in your blood will help satiate me.\nMercedes: Emile? Wait... You... You're not Emile. You're the Death Knight. You may look like him, but you are not him. He would never say such a thing.\nJeritza: What care I for names? I care only to kill or be killed.\nMercedes: I see. So you want to kill me? Then do as you must. You are within your rights.\nJeritza: My... rights?\nMercedes: Mother and I must be the reason the Death Knight exists within you. A young boy left all alone in House Bartels without us? I can't imagine how lonely and terrible that must have been. To our half-siblings who bore no Crests, we were nothing more than... intruders. Their horrible words and violent actions were only bearable because the three of us supported one another through it. All alone in a place like that... It's little wonder that you broke down as you have. We should have rescued you. We should have offered ourselves to save you.\nJeritza: Nonsense...\nMercedes: However, we cannot turn back the hands of time. Atonement is all I have for you now.\nJeritza: You don't understand anything...\nMercedes: Emile?\nJeritza: The day you left, 18 years ago... I told Mother to leave me there.\nMercedes: Wh-what? But why did you do such a thing?\nJeritza: I... wanted to protect you. I am glad that we are reunited. I am happy that you are alive. I... I am so sorry, my dear sister.\n(Jeritza leaves)\n\nMercedes: Emile..._(Location: Mercedes' Room)\n\nJeritza: You trust too much. Allowing someone who has turned their blade on you to come near.\nMercedes: Because there are two sides to you, you fear that I endanger myself?\nJeritza: I am nothing more than a merciless killer. A demon whose only pleasure is found within death's shadow. Such a creature should not be allowed near you, dear sister.\nMercedes: Just what are you implying, Emile?\nJeritza: I have come to bid you farewell. Today, I will leave the monastery for good. If I stay, it is only a matter of time before I hurt you. Just like I did those in House Bartels.\nMercedes: You can't leave... But if it must be so, then answer me this before you depart. Why did you kill your father?\nJeritza: ... On the day I took his life, Father had just discovered that you and Mother were hiding at a church in the Kingdom. He was considering bringing both of you back home, but by then, Mother was past the age to bear children. And so he proclaimed that he would take the only other female of the Lamine bloodline... That he would take you as his wife. What happened after that... I remember nothing of it. How I killed him or what his final words were.\nMercedes: You... You did it for me. To protect me...\nJeritza: Regardless of reasons, a demon is a demon. I have said enough.\nMercedes: Hold on! That isn't fair!\nJeritza: Not fair?\nMercedes: No! You can't just tell me all of that and then vanish forever! Please stay. At least until this horrible war meets its end. I want you around just a while longer...\nJeritza: But...all that I do results in harm to others. You saw it yourself. The demon that lives within bears his fangs indiscriminately. You... know all of this, and still you wish for me to remain?\nMercedes: Even if I am hurt -- or worse yet, killed -- if it is by your hand, I will find peace. I am and will always be your big sister, Emile.\nJeritza: Mercedes, I...\nMercedes: I love you, Emile. That never changes. Understand?\nJeritza: I understand... Then... I will remain here a while longer. Until we see this war through, I will remain by your side._null_null_null_
