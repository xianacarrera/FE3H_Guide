27_41_Leonie: Phew... Oh, Professor! Are you training too? I was just about to finish up, but if you want to join in, I can stick around a while longer.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You don't have to stay just for me.\nChoice 2: I might be here a while.\nLeonie: Oh, no. It's fine! Just do your thing. Don't mind me. Come on. Don't be shy.\n(scene transition)\n\nLeonie: Phew! I'm beat...but we're finally done.\nByleth: You didn't have to stay for my whole routine.\nLeonie: I was...already training when you got here, and I...finished right alongside you... Guess I...outlasted you, huh?\nByleth: It's not a competition.\nLeonie: Speak for yourself! I'm always looking to improve. By the way, Professor. Something I wanted to ask.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Let's hear it, then.\nChoice 2: Ask me whatever you want.\nLeonie: Are you really Captain Jeralt's kid?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I don't know.\nChoice 2: That's what I'm told.\nLeonie: That's a pretty detached tone to take about your own family. What's your opinion of him, then? You must look up to him, at least?\nByleth: I respect him, of course.\nLeonie: Hm. It doesn't sound like you really appreciate him. You didn't even know until you came here that he used to lead the Knights of Seiros, did you? If it weren't for him, you wouldn't be half the person you are now. You've probably never even thought about how lucky you are. Ugh! OK, this really bothers me! Listen up. I don't care if you're the teacher and I'm the student. I'm going to outshine you. I know you were some famous mercenary before you came here, but let me tell you something... I'm going to be better than you ever were! In fact, I'll surpass you in no time at all, so don't blink. You might miss it.\nByleth: …_Leonie: Hey, Professor. Got a minute? Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you. I didn't mean to lose my temper. I was rude to you. I should have known better.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's all right.\nChoice 2: I wasn't offended.\nLeonie: Hah. I thought you might say that. In that way, you're just like Captain Jeralt. You accept other people. You don't let petty details get under your skin.\nByleth: How do you know my father?\nLeonie: Well, when I was a kid, I kind of latched on to him. I've been calling myself his apprentice ever since. He spent some time in the village I grew up in. Actually, you weren't with him back then. Why not?\nByleth: I don't remember.\nLeonie: Huh. Maybe he left you with a relative or something. Anyway, back then, Jeralt's job was to deal with poachers—well, they were bandits—but we called them poachers. Nobody in the village could stand up to them. But your dad? He took them on like it was nothing. I was so impressed! All I could think was how amazing mercenaries were. I'd lived in that tiny village my whole life, so to me, Captain Jeralt was nothing short of a legend. So I went right up to him, and I told him I was going to be his apprentice. He didn't stick around long after that, but he did teach me a lot while he was with us. Tactics, strategy, training routines—it was all so new and exciting! So after he left, I kept at it. Kept training. Just like he taught me.\nByleth: I'm glad you got to see him again.\nLeonie: Me too. I always planned to meet him again, once I became a top-tier mercenary. But I'm just glad I got to see him. To thank him properly and all. I've spent my whole life working to become a great mercenary like your father. There were so many times when I wanted to ask his advice, but I couldn't. I just had to make do. That's how I've made it this far. Just hard work, all on my own. But then you come along... And it's like you don't appreciate Captain Jeralt at all, or how lucky you were to have him around your whole life! Ugh! It still really bothers me! You might be his kid, but I'm still his best apprentice! Got it?!\nByleth: …_Leonie: Hey, Professor. Can we talk? I feel terrible about the last time we spoke. I was trying to apologize, and just ended up losing my temper again. I'm really sorry.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's all right.\nChoice 2: I don't mind.\nLeonie: I figured you'd say that, but I still feel like an idiot. Somehow, I just have a hard time keeping my feelings in check around you. And I think if I don't just tell you what I'm thinking, we'll never be able to have a normal conversation. So, let me clear the air. I want us to, uh...engage...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Engage in what? A duel?\nChoice 2: You want to get engaged?!\nLeonie:\nChoice 1 response: Yeah! Exactly.\nChoice 2 response: Yeah, I—wait, what?! No! I mean in a duel!\nLeonie: I know it's a sudden thing to ask, but I'm not going to feel settled until I know where I stand. Would you do that for me?\nByleth: All right.\nLeonie: Good. Don't hold back, OK? I want to see you at your absolute best!\n(scene transition)\n\nLeonie: Phew! You got me. I'm completely outmatched...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Sorry.\nChoice 2: You held your own.\nLeonie:\nChoice 1 response: No, don't apologize! This is what I needed.\nChoice 2 response: Maybe, but you were definitely stronger. Honestly, that's what I needed to see.\nLeonie: You're a true successor to Captain Jeralt's style of swordplay. I almost felt like you were him. I thought I was competing with you...but that's as pointless as competing against him would've been. So instead of that, I'm going to focus on keeping the promise I made to him.\nByleth: What promise?\nLeonie: Captain Jeralt said that, if anything should happen to him, I'd have to support you in his place. He didn't sound serious at the time, but it was right before he...you know. Before we lost him. So, I've decided. I'd like to do just what he said. I know I'm not as strong as I need to be. But I swear to you...I'll train until I am. What do you say? Can I call you my employer?\nByleth: I know I can count on you.\nLeonie: Yes! It's official! I'll protect you, no matter what!_null_null_Leonie: Professor? What are you doing here?\nByleth: I could ask you the same.\nLeonie: I was talking to Jeralt. The sky feels so close...like you can almost touch the stars. I thought my voice might reach him.\nByleth: What were you saying?\nLeonie: That the war's finally over. And that his kid and his greatest apprentice did an amazing job out there! Haha, maybe I'm overselling the part I played.\nByleth: You were amazing.\nLeonie: Thanks, but I was nothing compared to you. I feel like an idiot for ever thinking I could surpass you. I have managed to keep my promise though. So, how would you feel about hiring me again? Can't exactly go and break my word now, can I?\nByleth: Your promise is already fulfilled.\nLeonie: The war's over, but the enemy might still be lurking! What if they're waiting until I'm gone to attack you?!\nByleth: I'll be fine.\nLeonie: But— Oh, I get it. You're probably pretty tired of me always trailing after you, huh?\nByleth: Not at all. In fact... I love you, Leonie.\nLeonie: Love?! As in... As in the way a commander loves his soldiers, right? Of course that's what you mean... Oh, that's...that kind of love! Can this really be happening? You want to marry me?... I... Of course will! You are being serious, right? That would be an awful joke... I'm sorry. I should have been honest. All that stuff about my promise a minute ago, it was mostly just an excuse for wanting to be near you. But, I'm not really the romantic type, so I had a hard time coming out and saying it. Are you sure this is what you want though? I know I'm not exactly conventional. Guess I'm really wearing this ring, then aren't I? But, I do still have a promise to keep with Captain Jeralt too.\nLeonie: You've got a big job ahead of you, building a whole new Fódlan. I'm going to support you through all of that. Make sure it never gets to be too much. Then that's that! I promise to protect you until death parts us! And...I'll be happy for you to do the same for me.

27_39_(Sylvain speaks to a girl)\n\nSylvain: Well, hello there, gorgeous. You're looking lovely today. Join me on a stroll around town?\n(scene transition; Sylvain speaks to another girl)\n\nSylvain: Aw, is a sweet girl like you doing all this hard work by yourself? That's no good. Allow me to help.\nLeonie: …\n(scene transition)\n\nLeonie: Hi.\nSylvain: Oh, hey, Leonie. Sorry, but I'm kind of in a hurry right now.\nLeonie: Hey. Hey! Get back here!\nSylvain: Whoa. No need to yell. Do you need something?\nLeonie: You chat up all the girls like that, don't you?\nSylvain: What a terrible thing to say! I see a girl, I figure it would be rude just to pass her by without at least a wink... or a nice word. But you knew that. So I'm going to get going now. See ya, Leonie.\nLeonie: Now, hold on! How come it's not rude for you to just pass me by?!\nSylvain: Me? Pass who now?\nLeonie: Look at me! I'm a girl, you know!\nSylvain: Uh... Oh, I see. A girl. You're...a girl. Huh. Sorry. I know it's true in theory, but it looks like my brain just didn't want to accept it. But you're correct. You are a beautiful girl in your own right. Yes. That is a statement with which I agree. I am ever so terribly sorry for being so rude, my lady. How can I ever make this up to you?\nLeonie: Uh, hang on, back up. Don't get the wrong idea.\nSylvain: Seriously, I feel just dreadful about how I acted! This is the first time I've done anything like this. It's shocking that I'm capable of such low behavior. Even if you are a somewhat crude—I mean, spirited girl, that doesn't excuse my...\nLeonie: What did you just call me?\nSylvain: R-right... Of course... I'm sorry. I can't believe I was so thoughtless.\n(Sylvain leaves)\n\nLeonie: Hey! Acting pitiful won't get you anywhere! I won't just forget about this, you know!_Leonie: Hey.\nSylvain: Hey, Leonie… I mean… Hello, beautiful. What brings a sweet girl like you to a place like this?\nLeonie: Uh, I just came to the greenhouse to look at flowers. What's with you?\nSylvain: Nothing much. Nothing...much... I was just thinking about how sunflowers don't deserve to be stuffed away in a greenhouse. They'd bloom better out in the open! Just like you.\nLeonie: Could you cut the weird metaphors and just say what you want to say? Oh, wait. I get it. I'm not ladylike enough to fit in with all the pretty flowers.\nSylvain: No! OK, that compliment backfired. Let me try a different angle...\nLeonie: This is a joke, right? Tell me this is a joke.\nSylvain: What have you got against sunflowers, anyway? I think they're lovely, myself. If you think I only care about delicate flowers raised in a greenhouse, you've got me all wrong. Statuesque sunflowers, blooming proud and tall in the open air, have a beauty all their own.\nLeonie: Is that right?\nSylvain: You better believe it, and the same goes for you. You have a beauty unlike any other. I look at you, and I see sunflowers.\nLeonie: …\nSylvain: Mm?\nLeonie: Look, can you just...go back to normal?\nSylvain: At this point, I feel like anything I say is just going to make you more angry.\nLeonie: Why are you suddenly not capable of carrying on a normal conversation?\nSylvain: My eyes have been opened to the charms of the beautiful flower blooming right beside me. It's a whole new day for my heart.\nLeonie: You can quit messing with me at any time.\nSylvain: I'm not. I'm absolutely serious. You really are as charming as any flower. I see that now.\nLeonie: Would you stop? This is getting weird.\nSylvain: Even sincerity doesn't work? What kind of flirting is going to satisfy you? You know what? I'm just going to leave you alone for now, so I can get a fresh start some other time.\nLeonie: Right. Bye.\n(Sylvain leaves.)\n\nLeonie: Charming? Me, of all people? Like I'd actually believe that.\nLeonie: (blushing) Stupid._null_null_null_null_
27_29_Leonie: Hey, Lorenz. Got a minute?\nLorenz: Certainly. I trust you're well?\nLeonie: Doing great! I found a load of old weapons. Just got done hauling them out of storage.\nLorenz: Old weapons you say? If they are any interesting swords in there, I would love to see them.\nLeonie: They might only be good for training, but with a little care, who knows? Here, have some oil.\nLorenz: And...why exactly are you giving this to me?\nLeonie: Like I said, they need a little care. With a bit of maintenance, some of these will really shine!\nLorenz: Yes, I heard you. So why did you give me the oil?\nLeonie: It's for polishing, Lorenz. Don't tell me you've never polished a weapon before.\nLorenz: That is hardly a task befitting someone of my station. If you had an exquisite blade, something of real historical significance to complement my noble heritage, that would be another matter.\nLeonie: In that case, appraise while you polish. You're bound to find something good, working through these.\nLorenz: These seems as fine an occasion as any to air my grievances. I am a highborn noble. As such, it is my sworn duty to protect the commonfolk. I have no time for trivialities. What's more, you seem to be under the misapprehension that you can order me about. Please think carefully about how you speak to me.\nLeonie: I'm not ordering you around. And I'm not talking to you as a noble either. I'm asking you to help me with this. As a friend.\nLorenz: I am your friend, but I am also a noble. Those two qualities are not mutually exclusive.\nLeonie: Oh, good! Let's get to it, then, buddy!\nLorenz: Nnngh..._Lorenz: Hello, Leonie. Busy as usual, I see.\nLeonie: Yep. Lots to do, not like you fancy nobles. Hey, can't you see all this stuff I'm carrying? Come on, move over already.\nLorenz: Alas, I cannot comply with your request.\nLeonie: Can't even ask a noble to step to the side, huh? That's a joke, right? You're kidding?\nLorenz: You've injured your foot. I could tell immediately by the way you are favoring it.\nLeonie: What?!\nLorenz: Heavy lifting will only worsen the injury. Please, permit me to examine it.\nLeonie: Hey, cut that out! Isn't that improper or something, bowing to a commoner?\nLorenz: I am not bowing to you. I am tending your wound.\nLeonie: That's not what it'll look like. Hey, it's fine! Leave it!\nLorenz: Easing the burdens of the commonfolk is a natural obligation of the nobility. Now, hold still and keep quiet for a moment, if you would be so kind.\nLeonie: That's a real pretty way to talk about sitting in castles doing nothing. Let me tell you, everyone in my village is so grateful to be taxed up to the eyeballs for the privilege of— ow!\nLorenz: Oh, it's quite swollen. And you're feverish! Fortunately, I do have an ointment here that should be of use.\nLeonie: What, you just carry that stuff around with you?\nLorenz: Certainly. It won't do to be unprepared if I happen across someone in need.\nLeonie: I don't get you, Lorenz.\nLorenz: It seems I've neglected to pack bandages. I'm afraid this handkerchief will have to suffice.\nLeonie: What, that fancy thing? Bit of a waste, isn't it? Hey, no thanks! I don't need some noble's pity!\nLorenz: What about the help of a friend? I am as much that as I am a noble, if you recall.\nLeonie: More of your weird logic.\nLorenz: There, that should ease the pain. And since you are recovering, allow me to carry this burden for you as well. There we are. Now, farewell.\n(Lorenz leaves.)\n\nLeonie: I really don't understand that guy. Oh no — I completely forgot to thank him!_Leonie: Hey. Got a minute?\nLorenz: Ah, Leonie. Are we to sharpen swords again?\nLeonie: No, I came to give you this handkerchief back. Sorry, I know I held onto it for a while.\nLorenz: …\nLeonie: You lent me this. Remember?\nLorenz: I recall giving it to you. It is a noble's duty to give to the commonfolk. In return, the commoner need only pay respect.\nLeonie: That's nice. But you left out the part where the nobles take all the stuff the regular folks make.\nLorenz: Yes, the commonfolk give the fruits of their labor — willingly, I might add — as a token of that respect. The head of Sauin Village offers his tribute in exactly that spirit, you know.\nLeonie: Sauin? That's... My village. You knew?\nLorenz: Of course. We granted exclusive hunting rights to Sauin, and forbade outsiders from poaching. In fact, when we received complaints about just that, we hired mercenaries to deal with the issue.\nLeonie: So that's what brought Jeralt...\nLorenz: Hm? What was that?\nLeonie: Nothing. Look, just take the handkerchief. I'm returning something I borrowed from a friend.\nLorenz: Very well. As your friend, I will accept it.\nLeonie: You know, I really wish you wouldn't think of nobles as only giving and commoners as only receiving. Friends help each other, without thinking about status. And that help goes both ways.\nLorenz: Quite so. And when I require the aid of a friend, I assure you I will happily recognize it. But only with friends. In the main, I must continue to refuse assistance of the commonfolk. For a noble to accept would be disgraceful. Haha!\n(Lorenz leaves.)\n\nLeonie: Huh. I always thought he was just stuck-up. Turns out, he just has this grand idea of nobility he's trying to live up to. Oh no! I didn't even give him the handkerchief!_Lorenz: It's only a scratch, Leonie. I'm all right.\nLeonie: One mistake like that in battle and you're done. This is your weapon hand, isn't it? Let me stop the blood.\nLorenz: Apologies for the trouble.\nLeonie: No trouble. And no apologies. \"Thanks\" is what you say when a friend helps you out. Ah, darn...\nLorenz: What's wrong?\nLeonie: I need a bandage to stop the bleeding, but this is all I've got.\nLorenz: My handkerchief.\nLeonie: I was only carrying it around to give back to you, anyway. Mind if I use it for this?\nLorenz: Very well. I suppose that's fitting, in a way.\nLeonie: (laughs) I guess so. Not that I'm happy you're bleeding. I'm glad you'll accept it though. In the past, you might have refused it.\nLorenz: Yes, I might have made it an issue of commoners giving aid to the nobility, or some such.\nLeonie: I didn't understand why you were so strict about it, but I think I kind of get it now. You know, if every noble were like you, the world would be a better place.\nLorenz: Perhaps. But you were right. Many great deeds are accomplished by friends working together. Especially when those friends are as capable as you.\nLeonie: Me?\nLorenz: I hope this is not the first time I have told you this, Leonie, but you are an exceptional individual. By insisting on matters of status in dealing with you, I have done you a terrible disservice. For that, please accept my apology. Let us promise to look out for one another, as friends, from now on.\nLeonie: No need for vows. That's how I've always seen it. You weren't wrong about nobles and commoners each having their own roles. But the important thing is we help each other.\nLorenz: That is precisely what being friends with you has helped me to understand. In fact, I've begun to think of you as rather something more.\nLeonie: Huh? Sorry, what did you say?\nLorenz: I said, I hope we'll always give each other support!_A+_null_
27_35_Raphael: Hey, Leonie! Are you just getting back? Whoa! What's with the bag? It's huge!\nLeonie: Oh, this? Ha... I thought I'd get all my chores done at once. Guess it got a little out of hand. Sorry to be a pain, but could you help me out?\nRaphael: I'm happy to help! Where'd you go to get all this stuff?\nLeonie: Well, first it was just the cloth scraps from the tailor, then it was the used oil from a restaurant in town... After that, it was the books the scholars didn't know what to do with. I mean, that was just on the way.\nRaphael: Whoa. It sounds like you did a lot of running around today.\nLeonie: It wasn't so bad! I just figured it would save time if I did it all in one trip.\nRaphael: You planned all that out? Impressive! What are you gonna do with all the stuff you got?\nLeonie: The scraps will be good for dish cloths, and I can make soap from the oil. The books are just to help with my studies.\nRaphael: You really can't let anything go to waste, can you?\nLeonie: Nope. Can't stand the idea.\nRaphael: Who knew you were so thoughtful! I mean, with actual thinking ahead. You're so generous to everyone and always making me food. I never knew how much thought you put into it!\nLeonie: I cook to relax. And it's nice to see how enthusiastic you get about eating what I make. Whatever I give away is just the stuff that isn't useful to me. I pick up all sorts of things when I'm in town. Giving things like that to people who need them, or who actually use them, makes sure they aren't wasted.\nRaphael: That makes sense. You gotta use up the stuff you've got, after all. Hey, do you think you're like this because you didn't have much growing up?\nLeonie: I guess things were tough, now that you mention it. The folks in my village definitely aren't rich. My dad had to go through a lot of trouble to get the recommendations I needed to go to the academy. That doesn't mean I've grown up to be stingy. It just means I don't like to squander. Anyway, enough of that. It's in poor taste to go on about your own hardships. I've always got time for a meal with a friend. And it just so happens I've picked up some choice meat today. Why don't we share it?\nRaphael: Now you're speaking my language!_Leonie: Oh, it's Raphael. What's he doing at that desk?\nRaphael: …\nLeonie: Hey! Are you studying? I thought you'd given up on it. Nice to see you're...\nRaphael: Waaaugh!\nLeonie: What the?!\nRaphael: Oh! Leonie!\nLeonie: What's wrong? Why are you crying?\nRaphael: I-I just got a thank you letter from my little sister!\nLeonie: Okay, maybe start from the beginning.\nRaphael: My little sister lives with my grandpa now. She's had to deal with so much now that I've decided not to take over the family business.\nLeonie: You might have to back up a bit more before this starts to makes sense to me.\nRaphael: Our parents were merchants, but they died in an accident. We had some money saved at first, but... But Grandpa isn't healthy enough to work, and I'm not smart enough to work a job that requires... much thinking.\nLeonie: That's really tough. Hard to make a fortune with just your strength, I'm sure.\nRaphael: I had to sell all our valuables just to pay my way here so I could become a knight!\nLeonie: Wow. That's a lot of pressure.\nRaphael: My sister wants the best for me, but — she's the smart one in the family! She's the one that should be here! When I ask if she needs anything, she always says she's fine. She doesn't want to ask for anything 'cause she knows I'm having such a hard time here!\nLeonie: She sounds like a great kid. So, what did the letter say?\nRaphael: It said she's happy and thankful for all the study materials I sent her!\nLeonie: That's good, right? Wait... Where did you find extras?\nRaphael: I couldn't find any, so I just sent her mine! It's like you said, right? It's better to give them to someone who will use them instead of letting them go to waste!\nLeonie: Um, don't take this the wrong way, but don't think you've still got things to learn? Well, I guess if it makes her happy, it's worth it. Maybe I can scrounge up something for her too._Leonie: Hey! Writing to your sister again?\nRaphael: You bet! Gotta reply to these things as soon as they come in!\nLeonie: You had one last week too. It's good to see you're both so good about staying in touch. It's especially important when there's a war going on.\nRaphael: Yeah. Oh! That reminds me! My sister wrote to say how much she loved the painting supplies you sent!\nLeonie: Good. I'm glad gathering those pigments paid off.\nRaphael: You even made her a brush! I really appreciate you doing all that for her.\nLeonie: I was fascinated with painting at that age. I was a pretty artistic kid, if you can believe it. Not a lot of time for it when you're hungry, though.\nRaphael: Sounds like you had a pretty rough time growing up, too, huh?\nLeonie: I guess so. We never thought of it that way. But it's true the children in my village don't usually get to choose their futures. Any one of us could have had the talent for artistic genius and never even noticed. I was one of the lucky ones. I only got to follow my passion thanks to my father and all the other folks. That's why, once I come into my own, the first thing I'll do is head back there and help the other kids.\nRaphael: Oh, wow. It's like all the kids in your village are counting on you.\nLeonie: Haha, no need to exaggerate it. Besides, it's not like I'm unique. You're working hard for your sister's future, aren't you?\nRaphael: Yeah. It's like me and you are both carrying big weights. We should try sharing our weights with one another! You know, lighten both of our loads!\nLeonie: Huh?\nRaphael: If we share our problems, then we only gotta carry half the weight, right? It works out for everybody!\nLeonie: It's... probably a good thing you didn't try to take on your family's business. If you take half of my burden, and I take half of yours, the total's still the same.\nRaphael: Nah, that doesn't sound right. Everything's lighter when you don't gotta carry it alone.\nLeonie: …\nLeonie: Haha, on second thought, you might be right. With that attitude, and the right partner to share the burden, maybe it is only half the weight.\nRaphael: Now you're getting it! It's a waste of energy to struggle alone when there's someone who can help you!\nLeonie: That's true. And I do hate waste, as you well know. So when it comes to working toward the future you're after, I won't fall short.\nRaphael: Great! And you should never fall short on sharing a big meal with me too!\nLeonie: Deal!_null_null_null_
27_30_Lysithea: I... I think I'm gonna pass out... Aghh!\nLeonie: Whoa! Lysithea? You're really pale!\nLysithea: Yeah, I've been feeling really queasy all morning... I'm just heading back to my quarters to rest...\nLeonie: Can you even make it there in that state? Here, climb on my back. I'll carry you.\nLysithea: Wuh... What? No...no... I'm not some sort of...infant.\nLeonie: Always worried about looking like a kid. No time for that now. Just get on!\nLysithea: …\n(Scene transition)\n\nLysithea: I'm feeling a bit better now. I should be OK from here. Thank you so much, Leonie. I hope I wasn't too heavy... Was I?\nLeonie: No, not at all. Actually made for a fun bit of training.\nLysithea: Uh, training?\nLeonie: Yeah. Carrying someone around is good for the legs. You're just the right weight for it too. I might ask you to help me train again sometime! Anything can be a kind of training with the right attitude, you know?\nLysithea: Are you always thinking about training?\nLeonie: Well, I can't devote all my time purely to training. So it's more efficient if I can train while I get other stuff done at the same time.\nLysithea: Wouldn't that actually be...rather inefficient?\nLeonie: Huh? What do you mean?\nLysithea: Well, for example, if you're training for endurance, it seems running would be a better approach. If you're only ever training by cramming it in with other tasks, you won't be getting the best results. I am no expert on the subject, but even I can logic that one out.\nLeonie: Come to think of it, you do always seem to stick to a pretty rigid schedule, don't you? I've noticed that you focus completely on whatever it is you've set out to do. Then you switch to something else, and focus completely on that.\nLysithea: You've noticed, have you?\nLeonie: Now that I think about it, you may be right. Maybe that is the more efficient way to do things. Hey, you're really bright. Lysithea! Thanks so much for the helpful advice!\n(Leonie leaves)\n\nLysithea: That was nice of Leonie to check on me and carry me all the way to my quarters. And in the end, I just lectured her! She did thank me for it, but... Ugh, I probably could've handled that better._Leonie: Hey, I'm about to take out the trash. Got anything you want me to take?\nLysithea: Uh, how about these? Just some old study notes of mine.\nLeonie: Wow, that's quite the pile there. You sure it's all fine to throw away?\nLysithea: Of course. It's all safely stored in my brain now. If I concentrate, I can access any of it with ease.\nLeonie: Why am I not surprised? I wish I had even half your power of concentration. OK, here we go. Ugh...this is pretty heavy! Well, it'll be a good workout. Oh, but you were telling me not to take my training so lightly. Still, can't hurt to get a little exercise in. I'll just take it at a run. See you later!\n(Leonie leaves)\n\nLysithea: Hm.\n(Scene transition)\n\nLeonie: Hm? What is it, Lysithea? Was there something in that pile of paper you wanted to hang on to, after all?\nLysithea: No, that's not it. There's just...something I want to say to you. I'm sorry for saying your way of doing things was inefficient. You've clearly grown plenty strong, doing things as you have. Not to mention multitasking and training in that way surely presents interesting challenges.\nLeonie: Well, sure. But, if everyone has their own methods, then your methods aren't wrong either. All you did was share with me, so there's no need for apologies. Still, it's probably me to imitate your levels of focus and concentration. How do you even manage to throw yourself into only one thing like that?\nLysithea: I haven't much choice—I can't waste even a single moment.\nLeonie: I can understand that. I'm sort of the same way. I hate feeling like I'm not getting enough work done. Anyway, you should just do what works for you. You've got something you want to achieve, right? That's why you feel pressured to study so hard.\nLysithea: Yes...\nLeonie: Then focus on what matters to you. Leave the rest to people who have the time for it. And hey, if you need any heavy lifting done, you know where to go! The way I see it, it's all training.\nLysithea: You know, Leonie. You're so kind, so strong...\nLeonie: Whoa. What's with the compliments all of a sudden?\nLysithea: I was just thinking what incredible partner you'd make. Really, you've got all of the perfect qualities!\nLeonie: Wait?\nLysithea: I'm not simply saying that. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say.\nLeonie: Ha, you're making me blush! What a strange way to compliment someone._null_null_null_null_
37_32_Marianne: Being kicked must have hurt. Didn't it, Dorte? Do they think you won't gallop unless you're in pain? It must be difficult letting those brutes ride you.\nLeonie: Hey, Marianne! What are you up to?\nMarianne: Ah! N-nothing.\nLeonie: Really? I was sure I heard you talking to someone.\nMarianne: …\nLeonie: By the way, are you free right now?\nMarianne: Is there something you need?\nLeonie: I was about to go buy towels and soap, but the girls saddled me with all these specific requests. They want it all to look cute, or to smell a certain way, but all that's just nonsense to me. I've always made my own towels out of old scraps, and soap from used cooking oil. I've never given it much thought beyond that.\nMarianne: Oh...\nLeonie: But I've noticed you've got some really nice things. So, you have an eye for that stuff, right? Obviously I'd give you all the credit. And I'm sure everyone would be really grateful for your help.\nMarianne: No, no. I don't deserve that kind of praise.\nLeonie: Really? I don't think that's true. Come on, you'll be doing me a big favor.\nMarianne: My adoptive father tells me I shouldn't stray too far from the monastery.\nLeonie: That's nonsense! You've got to get some fresh air now and again.\nMarianne: I should stay. Besides, I wouldn't be much help. I don't think anyone would like whatever I pick out anyway. It would all go to waste. And I'm sure that having me around would just cause you misfortune, Leonie.\nLeonie: Are you serious?\nMarianne: I should stay here by myself...\nLeonie: Now hold on just a second. You'll cause me misfortune? What kind of backwards talk is that?! If you really don't want me around, then at least come out and say it straight! I'm sorry for the unwelcome invitation. Don't worry, I won't make the same mistake again.\nMarianne: …_Leonie: …Oh. Hey, Marianne.\nMarianne: Um. Ah. Leonie?\nLeonie: I thought greenhouse duty was mine today. What are you doing here?\nMarianne: Oh. I...um. I'm sorry.\nLeonie: You've been avoiding me ever since I lost my temper, haven't you? You're probably scared of me now. In the moment, I was hurt. I'm sure you had good reasons to act the way you did. If you want me to leave you alone, I will. I promise, you've got nothing to fear from me.\nMarianne: Leonie, I...\nLeonie: I've watered all the plants, so I'm done here. I'll get out of your way.\nMarianne: W-wait!\nLeonie: Huh? Hey, what is it?\nMarianne: It's. Um...\nLeonie: …\nMarianne: I don't mean to bother you. I'm sorry for keeping you here.\nLeonie: No, not at all. Thanks for keeping me. Honestly, I've been worried about you. If you ever want to talk, about anything, just say so. I'll make time.\nMarianne: I've been avoiding people for most of my life, so I'm not the best at speaking.\nLeonie: I know it's hard. You've been through a lot, but it's worth the extra effort to talk to your friends.\nMarianne: I make everyone uncomfortable. I just don't know how to carry on a conversation.\nLeonie: Hey, we're having one right now. And I'm telling you, I'm not uncomfortable. I'm actually really happy. So don't worry about me. And it's OK to be quiet sometimes, but try to find a middle ground, at least. Otherwise, you'll never get any better.\nMarianne: Oh...\nLeonie: As far as what to talk about, anything's good. Hobbies, things you like, a dream you had last night... Really, anything.\nMarianne: OK, then. I, um... I like this flower. I think it's nice.\nLeonie: I think so too! Did you know that, where I come from, those have a completely different color?\nMarianne: Oh! Really? I'd like to see that.\nLeonie: Great! Come visit my village someday. In fact, we should invite all of our friends. It'll be fun!\nMarianne: Oh, yes! That would be very exciting!_null_null_null_null_
27_37_Leonie: Oh! Hello, Seteth.\nSeteth: Hello, Leonie. I imagine you are here to fish?\nLeonie: Yeah, this is a great spot for it. You must be a pretty experienced fisherman, huh?\nSeteth: Actually, while I have enjoyed the hobby for a long time, I must admit I am less than proficient.\nLeonie: Now that you mention it, I can see that you're not having much luck today.\nSeteth: It is likely because I am not using any bait.\nLeonie: Well, that explains it! But why bother fishing at all, if you're not even trying to catch something?\nSeteth: Truthfully, I fish only so that I might relax. It is soothing to me, to cast the line and watch the water ripple... My days are busy, even hectic. It helps to find peace and quiet every so often.\nLeonie: Oh, that makes sense. Still, if you're going to go to all the trouble, you may as well actually bait the line.\nSeteth: Maybe so. But, to my chagrin, I do not even know what type of bait to use. I learned to fish by accompanying my wife. She was always the one to bait the hooks. She would hand me the rod, and I would cast my line. I never paid attention to how the rest was done.\nLeonie: Ah. And your wife, where is she now?\nSeteth: She passed away, quite some time ago. Since then, I have only to fish on my own. Even so, I... I find peace out here. Bait or no bait. And what about you? Why do you fish?\nLeonie: Me? Just for the fish, actually. For me, it's purely practical. Catch a bite now, one less meal to worry about later. Hunting, fishing... Whatever it takes to get by. That's how I've always done it. I'm not exactly starving right now, but back then, if I couldn't catch something, I'd go hungry. So getting the hang of it was pretty vital.\nSeteth: I would certainly say so. I imagine it is immensely satisfying to catch a fish when the need is so great.\nLeonie: Probably, yeah. The need makes it more purposeful. But hey, if you ever want to try fishing for real, I'd be happy to share my bait with you. And if you catch something, I'll cook it up nicely for you. How's that for motivation?\nSeteth: Oh, are you a skilled chef also?\nLeonie: Can't promise it'll be fancy, but it'll taste good.\nSeteth: Impressive. Wouldn't you know it, I am suddenly overcome with the urge to excel.\nLeonie: Great! Let's get started!_Leonie: Hello again, Seteth. Oh, full basket! Big catch?\nSeteth: Indeed. Thanks to you, I now know all about the proper use of bait.\nLeonie: Even so, that's quite the haul!\nSeteth: I have developed a few tricks of my own as well. In my enthusiasm, I may have gotten a little greedy.\nLeonie: Oh. Yeah?\nSeteth: Once I started to catch fish, I began to pay very close attention to the number I had caught. I hear it is not uncommon for one to become preoccupied with that sort of thing. And when I recalled the prospect of having what I caught cooked for me, the challenge was too tempting to ignore. But alas, it seems I have gotten a little more preoccupied than is appropriate for my age.\nLeonie: Well, it's only natural. Seeing what you've already got just makes you curious how far you can take it.\nSeteth: It has made fishing an even richer experience for me. And for that, I must thank you.\nLeonie: Don't mention it. Actually, I should thank you too.\nSeteth: Oh?\nLeonie: Yeah. Used to be, I only ever fished for food. Lately, though, I've been coming here just to relax. I do still eat the fish, of course, but I appreciate fishing in a whole new way now.\nSeteth: Seems we have both made worthwhile discoveries. So, which is it today? Hunger or relaxation?\nLeonie: I'd only planned to take it easy, but seeing all you've caught has definitely me hungry.\nSeteth: I had planned to bring all of them to you, regardless. Take as many as you please.\nLeonie: Hey, thanks! In that case, why don't we eat together? You can leave all the cooking to me!_Leonie: Today was a great day for fishing, wasn't it?\nSeteth: It was. Though I did lose to you in numbers.\nLeonie: You won on size though. Some of these fish are huge! And it was you who caught this beauty.\nSeteth: It is a lovely specimen. The fins are rather like wings, and the scales are reminiscent of a lustrous rainbow. But I have heard this type of fish does not taste good.\nLeonie: It's a little bland, but it's not bad. You just need to fry it in oil to bring the flavor out. There are lots of little bones, too, so you need to be careful eating it.\nSeteth: Truly you are an expert, Leonie. I would be delighted if you would cook for us again.\nLeonie: Happily! You know, once this war is over, I'll be able to make even more elaborate dishes. I'm sure none of it will compare to your wife's cooking though.\nSeteth: Entirely different styles. I very much look forward to seeing what you come up with. Yet another reason to end this war swiftly.\nLeonie: I'm flattered, but that doesn't seem like a good motivation to fight.\nSeteth: On the contrary, it is better than the usual reasons. In the heat of battle, it is little details like a friend's cooking that I reach for to find my courage.\nLeonie: I have to admit, I didn't expect that from you. You're always so serious. But I value our fishing time too. With all the chaos, it's great to have a way to relax.\nSeteth: I hope there will come a time when we can fish like this, without worry, to our hearts' content.\nLeonie: Hope's not enough. We need to build that future with our own hands.\nSeteth: Agreed. But even after that is done, you had better not rest idle. I've grown quite fond of your cooking!\nLeonie: Don't worry, there's plenty more where that came from! Speaking of, time to handle today's haul.\nSeteth: Let me lend you a hand._null_null_null_
27_38_Leonie: Why am I so off? Yesterday wasn't like this. Some days, I just can't seem to hit anything.\nShamir: Your mind, body, and technique are not synchronized. Find balance between the three. You lack experience. You'll improve if you practice.\nLeonie: Now that you mention it, Shamir, how come I've never seen you train? Do you keep odd hours? Or are you just so good that you don't even need to anymore?\nShamir: I am always training. Look here.\nLeonie: A dagger?\nShamir: Watch.\nLeonie: Wow, nice throw! That was a long one! But, does throwing knives at pillars really count as shooting practice?\nShamir: Look closely.\nLeonie: Is that — a centipede?! You pierced it clean in half! How did you even see that?!\nShamir: I train everything. Eyes. Speed. Accuracy. Watch as the bird flies. Feel the wind. Measure the distance between objects. Not all training requires a weapon. Integrate training with your daily routine.\nLeonie: My daily routine, huh? That's great advice! Thanks, I'll do my best.\nShamir: Very good. Just be cautious._Shamir: I heard what you did. I'm disappointed, Leonie.\nLeonie: Um, hi, Shamir. What have you heard, exactly?\nShamir: You aimed your bow at a group of students passing through the monastery. Was this your idiotic idea of training? I told you to be cautious.\nLeonie: I'm sorry! Idiotic's a bit hard though, isn't it?\nShamir: What were you planning on doing after you took aim? Shooting passersby? Of course not. If you want to train, choose a target you can actually shoot.\nLeonie: I know. Everyone was pretty mad. I'm really am sorry.\nShamir: Nobody likes having a bow pointed at them.\nLeonie: My mentor used to do that kind of thing a lot.\nShamir: Mentor? Was that Jeralt? I dunno much about him. Would he really do that?\nLeonie: Would and did. Mostly when he was drunk, though.\nShamir: Not a good habit to emulate. From now on, only aim at bugs. Like I showed you.\nLeonie: But, um, I don't... Really like bugs.\nShamir: You don't like bugs? That should make you want to aim at them even more.\nLeonie: I just can't look at them. Seeing all the extra legs, and things. Ugh! Makes my skin crawl.\nShamir: Then just draw some spiders and hang them up on the walls. Aim at the drawings whenever you pass one. Overcome your fear of bugs as you train.\nLeonie: You want me to draw spiders?! Ew, no! Would that even help?\nShamir: Yes. I should know.\nLeonie: Huh? You were scared of them too?\nShamir: I was, but they don't bother me anymore.\nLeonie: Okay, you've talked me into it. I'll give it a try.\nShamir: And don't hang them where other people might pass.\nLeonie: Got it! Got it. Learned my lesson. Promise.\nShamir: I'm choosing to believe that._Leonie: Guess that's enough for now.\nShamir: You're improving, Leonie. No doubt a result of your new training routine.\nLeonie: Right, about that. I've been doing everything you said, but...\nShamir: Something wrong?\nLeonie: Not with my archery, but... I'm not getting any better at dealing with bugs. Even with all the practice, I just can't bring myself to look at a real, live spider.\nShamir: You're still aiming at the spiders I instructed you to draw? Let me see one.\nLeonie: Sure. Here.\nShamir: I... What is this?\nLeonie: What do you mean, what is it?! It's a spider!\nShamir: Ah, yes. I-I see now. It's quite — well, it's — hahaha!\nLeonie: What's so funny?!\nShamir: Haaah! Phew... I'm sorry. I lost my composure for a moment there. Your drawing is absolutely ridiculous.\nLeonie: Ridiculous?! That's what they look like, isn't it?!\nShamir: Do you know how many legs a spider has? Or what it's body looks like? Or ever seen one at all?\nLeonie: I just told you I can't even look at the little monsters!\nShamir: A lack of subtlety no doubt learned from your former mentor. Regardless, aiming at this target won't help you overcome your fears. Here, use one of my drawings instead. Consider it an apology for my outburst.\nLeonie: Oh, why did you have to be so detailed?!\nShamir: This much detail is necessary if you wish to identify your enemy's weak points.\nLeonie: Ew, it's too much! I can't stand the sight of it!\nShamir: This is guaranteed to help you overcome your fears and improve your archery in the process.\nLeonie: So, archery's secondary now, is it?\nShamir: You want to be a peerless mercenary, right? You'll never accomplish that if you're afraid of something as innocuous as a bug.\nLeonie: When you put it that way, I guess I'll have to. Okay, Shamir, you've talked me into it. First I'll take out the drawings, and then I'll move onto the real thing!\nShamir: Excellent. I look forward to seeing fewer spiders around here._null_null_null_
