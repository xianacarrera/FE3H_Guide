28_41_Linhardt: Well, hello, Professor. You came all the way to my room to— Oh. You've brought the materials from your lecture I slept through. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I won't do this again.\nChoice 2: Don't miss the lectures.\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1 response: It's rare for a nice professor like you to be so strict. Please, Professor. You must understand how difficult it is for me to fight the demon of drowsiness.\nChoice 2 response: It's not that I want to miss lectures...exactly. Drowsiness is my archnemesis. For some reason I just can't seem to win against it.\nLinhardt: Just talking about it makes me sleepy...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Let's wake you up with a bit of training, then.\nChoice 2: A trip to town might help your mood.\nChoice 3: You're not motivated enough.\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1 response: Oh no, I couldn't possibly. I would certainly injure myself if I tried to train while drowsy.\nChoice 2 response: That sounds more than a little exhausting. I think I'll stay in.\nChoice 3 response: It's not that I don't have enough motivation. The problem is that I don't have any at all. Not for useless things.\nLinhardt: I must compliment you though. By this point in most conversations, I'm bored senseless. But I'm enjoying this. I wonder why... What is it about you that fascinates me so? You're definitely a strange one.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm not strange.\nChoice 2: Maybe so.\nLinhardt: In truth, your very nature is odd. You're definitely not a commoner, but you don't seem like a noble, either. You're...something else. Or you could be a villain who came here to enact some evil plot. That wouldn't surprise me either.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm not a villain.\nChoice 2: Is that what you think?\nLinhardt: Hey, Professor... Will you ever allow me to investigate that Crest of yours? It won't hurt a bit, I swear. I'm sure I could find out all sorts of things about your Crest...and you. Of course, I'm not as experienced with such research as Professor Hanneman, but I do what I can. Someday, I think I might like to become a Crest scholar. You never know.\nByleth: Hm...\nLinhardt: Oh, don't trouble yourself. I didn't mean now. I've got a lot of other research I'm working on at the moment. I tend to start a project, get bored, and then leave it be. I might be ready to investigate your Crest soon. I'd have to tidy up a bit first. On that note... Goodnight, Professor._Linhardt: ...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What are you doing?\nChoice 2: Are you thinking about the battle?\nLinhardt: It's just... I was wondering why it seems as if no one values their own lives. Why do we fight until we die? Why do we kill without hesitation? I hate it. I don't like taking lives or even the sight of blood. In the last battle, some of the soldiers under my command died for foolish reasons. Those soldiers could have pulled back... Instead, they kept fighting...and were overrun. Am I supposed to be satisfied with the victory alone? Even at the cost of such life?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: No, I couldn't be satisfied with that.\nChoice 2: Yes, I could be satisfied with that.\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1 response: Exactly. I don't see the point. Honor? That's a foolish reason to give your life. Glory? Even worse.\nChoice 2 response: Really? I— Trading someone's life for a bit of honor and glory... You'll pardon me if I say I find that repulsive.\nLinhardt: Just the thought frightens me. I'm not suited for battle, Professor.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's not something you can control.\nChoice 2: There are some fights you can't run from.\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1: I'm happy you feel that way, but... It seems like so much in our world is decided by who wins or loses a fight. Very little is accomplished via diplomacy or even simple decency.\nChoice 2: I suppose that's the nature of the world, isn't it?\nLinhardt: Professor, you take the time to lead me and teach me like this every day... Could the reason be that you don't want me to die on the battlefield?\nByleth: As long as I'm here, I won't let you die.\nLinhardt: That's a bold statement, Professor. But for whatever reason, I want to believe you... You really are a strange person, you know. Professor, I wish to ask something of you. I...I don't want to kill. I don't want blood on my hands. I just want to lie on my back and soak up the sun filtering down through the trees... And I want you to help me make that reality._Linhardt: Hmm... Ah, yes...\nLinhardt: Professor. What brings you out so late?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I heard a strange voice.\nLinhardt: Oh, um... That was likely my voice.\nChoice 2: I could ask you the same.\nLinhardt: I've been worrying about something... I once asked you tot help me make this the sort of world where I can simply nap my days away. Then I thought, if the world becomes a peaceful place, all my Crest research might be for naught...\nByleth: Why's that?\nLinhardt: Well, I don't see how Crests have much use in times of peace. Certainly there are Crests that make you stronger and could be used in engineering. And I suppose Crests that increase magical abilities might help doctors heal injuries... Still, the possibilities seem limited. It's as if Crests were designed to be used only in times of war. Their power meant to bring about death and destruction.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Maybe you're right.\nChoice 2: I don't really understand.\nLinhardt: I cannot prove what I say is true, but suppose for a moment that it is... The longer this war goes on, the more useful my Crest research becomes. But if the war were to end today, we would go on living, perhaps not using the power of our Crests at all. It is truly my dream to be a Crest scholar, but I also dream of all the wonderful naps peace would bring. Saying it all out loud, it feels a rather stupid thing to worry over. Knowledge or peace? Sleep or war?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's not stupid.\nChoice 2: You shouldn't worry about it if it's stupid.\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1 response: Thank you, Professor. I appreciate the sentiment.\nChoice 2 response: You know, you're right. In the end, maybe it's not that stupid after all. It certainly isn't to me...\nLinhardt: Although, if I stop researching Crests, I'll have one less excuse to spend time with you. Professor. Don't make faces like that. People like you who listen to my blathering and then nod and smile as though what I say matters? People like you are very precious to me._null_null_Linhardt: Professor, I've been waiting for you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: How did you know I was coming here?\nChoice 2: You've livelier than normal.\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1 response: How much time do you suppose we have spent together? Enough that I believe I can predict how you'll feel about something.\nChoice 2 response: Oh, is it noticeable?\nLinhardt: The truth is... I want to ask you a once-in-a-lifetime question.\nByleth: Once in a lifetime?\nLinhardt: Um... Yes.\nLinhardt: I know that the end of the war hasn't granted you limitless free time.\nLinhardt: But you must have more time on your hands than you did during the war, yes?\nLinhardt: Would you spend that time with me?\nLinhardt: I want to know more about you. I want to solve the mysteries that surround you.\nLinhardt: I don't think I'll ever meet anyone more intoxicating than yourself.\nLinhardt: I want you to be mine and I want to be yours.\nLinhardt: Here is proof of my desire. Will you accept it?\n(Linhardt presents ring)\n\nByleth: Of course. I love you, Linhardt.\nLinhardt: Oh, thank goodness! I don't know what I would have done with myself had you turned me down.\nLinhardt: Though, I feel like I've come to understand rather a lot about you.\nLinhardt: So I didn't honestly think you'd reject me.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Wow, you're very confident.\nChoice 2: Hmm...\nLinhardt:\nChoice 1 response: Oh, just wait. I will understand you even more.\nChoice 2 response: You doubt me? But I was proven correct the very moment you took the ring.\nLinhardt: Our future together has only just begun.\nLinhardt: Before I become bored of this business, I wish to learn all there is about your Crest and your strength.\nLinhardt: And perhaps we'll even come up with ways I could help you guide Fódlan.\nLinhardt: I as a Crest scholar and you as a leader of Fódlan...\nLinhardt: We will take our first steps together into this new world, the two of us working as one.\nLinhardt: Once things settle down, we can retire to the countryside.\nLinhardt: A place where the air is fresh, the lakes are full of fish, the sun is warm, and where we may nap deeply.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I should've known this was about naps.\nChoice 2: I'm not into napping...\nLinhardt: Without naps, life is nothing but work!\nLinhardt: I value you too much to let you spend your whole life laboring for others. You're the hero of Fódlan after all.\nLinhardt: Besides, naps are the entire point of retirement!\nLinhardt: It may be some time until we can nap under a tree, peaceful sunlight filtering through the branches...\nLinhardt: But when that day comes? To have you there lying by my side...\nLinhardt: Paradise. And we will have made it so.

28_34_Linhardt: ...\nLinhardt: Petra, would you pause a moment?\nPetra: Yes? Are you wanting something?\nLinhardt: I was observing your spearwork, and I wonder if you don't think your transitions are sloppy.\nLinhardt: The way you move your arm before a strong thrust hinders your movement and slows your spear on its way back. It leaves a rather large opening.\nPetra: Which arm? My left or right?\nLinhardt: I think the right... No, actually it's both. It's something about the way you move your elbows.\nPetra: I am not understanding. Can you show me please?\nLinhardt: Demonstrate? No. I'd hate to get sweat all over my book.\nPetra: But I must correct this. Please.\nPetra: Or are you unable to do, and you can only teach?\nLinhardt: I am more of a theorist than a practitioner. I advise, and you implement. Very simple.\nPetra: Then...please advise again.\nLinhardt: It's all quite simple.\nLinhardt: Sometimes you make a big stab downwards, right? Before that, you lift up.\nLinhardt: At that point, you sort of let the tension go and stop. It ruins the momentum of the stab.\nPetra: How can I be lifting up with no... no unnecessary moving?\nLinhardt: It's the arm movement that's extraneous. Calculate the locus of the spear and the elasticity of the muscles.\nPetra: Locus...elasticity... Can you not just be showing me?\nPetra: Please. If you are showing me, I will learn it with quickness.\nLinhardt: I won't waste your time with such demonstrations. You're a smart one, Petra. You'll sort it out.\nLinhardt: Besides, I need to go now. I have...a prior appointment to keep.\nPetra: Linhardt only likes talking. It is on myself to prevail..._Petra: Linhardt. I have been waiting for much time. Please, watch me.\nLinhardt: Watch what, Petra? Whoa! Hey, careful with that spear!\n(screen fades to black with slash animations)\n\nPetra: How did you find that? I did more training.\nLinhardt: Ah, you took my advice, then.\nLinhardt: I will say, the problematic maneuver seems improved at least.\nPetra: At least? It is still no good?\nLinhardt: The spear isn't really my area of expertise, but I've seen enough training to understand the mechanics.\nLinhardt: I believe I can use that understanding to further help you improve your spearwork.\nPetra: My spearwork?\nLinhardt: Right. As I said, when you lift up and stab down, the momentum is ruined.\nLinhardt: You're trying to swing like a giant. You're not a giant, so that's a problem.\nLinhardt: So allow the spear's own momentum to do more of the hard work for you.\nPetra: Spear momentum…\nLinhardt: The spear is heavy. When you lift it up high, loosen your grip a little.\nPetra: At the top of my swing...loosen my grip. And then the weight will...carry it down?\nLinhardt: Precisely. When you put too much power into it, not only do you exhaust your grip, you tire yourself out.\nLinhardt: Got it? Ugh, all that effort is taking its toll on me.\nPetra: You are very clever. I wonder why you have hatred for training.\nLinhardt: Because training is too much like fighting, and I'd really rather not fight.\nLinhardt: Also, I find training terribly dull. Anyway. Good night.\n(Linhardt leaves)\n\nPetra: He does not use his cleverness. It is a very big waste.\nPetra: I want you to use your power, Linhardt..._Petra: Linhardt, I need to be asking for your wisdom. Will you consent?\nLinhardt: My wisdom? About?\nPetra: I was hunting earlier and the land gifted me with lots of game.\nPetra: It was all brought by me to the kitchen, and then—\nLinhardt: You're not asking me for help with the butchery, are you? If so, stop right there. I despise the sight of blood.\nPetra: No, I am not asking that. All of that work and care is given right after the hunting.\nPetra: Giving gratitude, bleeding, skinning, all has been done to be making very nice, fresh meat.\nPetra: That meat is sitting in the kitchen already.\nLinhardt: Oh, thank goodness. Then whatever do you need from me? I'm not much of a cook.\nPetra: I want to be smoking the meat, so we can be preserving it. There is a big quantity of it.\nPetra: But I am without enough firewood for the smoking… I am needing more than I was thinking I would.\nPetra: The darkness has fallen outside, so it will be difficult to be collecting it right now.\nLinhardt: Why not gather wood in the morning? Get some sleep now.\nPetra: This meat will not be waiting that long. It will be going to waste. Please… Do you have any suggesting for what I can do?\nPetra: You have much wisdom for giving, so I am hoping you will be helping me.\nLinhardt: OK, let me see… Easy-to-forage wood at this time of night…\nLinhardt: You know, there were a good number of desks and chairs in the ruined corner of the monastery.\nLinhardt: Some of the stuff there is salvageable, so none of it has been thrown away.\nLinhardt: There's definitely high-quality oak and beech out there. Both would be excellent for smoking meat.\nPetra: Is that factual? I was not knowing that! The wisdom you give is exceptional!\nLinhardt: Well, I wouldn't say that...\nLinhardt: As long as it's anything that looks broken beyond repair, no one should complain.\nPetra: I am giving you my gratitude, Linhardt. Now, let's be going.\nLinhardt: Pardon?\nPetra: You have all the wisdom about choosing wood for smoking. I am wanting your assistance.\nLinhardt: But it's bedtime… OK, fine. I can point out the choice smoking wood.\nLinhardt: Ugh… Then I'll have to help haul it all back, won't I?\nPetra: It would give me great happiness… There is no one better than you for this task!\nLinhardt: Please stop with the praising.\nLinhardt: All right, fine. I'll help.\nLinhardt: (yawning) I'm just...that nice a guy..._(the stables)\n\nPetra: Linhardt, please accept my apology. You are not deserving of this punishment…\nLinhardt: I am the one who suggested it would be great firewood. I suppose it's only fair I get punished too.\nLinhardt: (Crimson Flower) No one ever bothered to inform me that pile of trash was the property of the Imperial army. (Other Routes) How was I supposed to know the archbishop's favorite chair was stashed away under a pile of trash?\nLinhardt: My apologies, Petra. My idea turned out to be worthless.\nPetra: It was not worthless. It had great worth.\nPetra: You gave me great help so I could be smoking all of that meat. I give you my gratitude for that.\nLinhardt: Well, at least you'll have no worries about provisions.\nLinhardt: I just realized… They didn't actually tell us when the punishment will be over.\nPetra: You can be leaving if you are wanting to. I will not be telling anyone. This is my responsibility to take.\nLinhardt: How are you so obedient and yet so passionate at the— Oh! Look, Petra! The book you were searching for.\n(Linhardt gives Petra a book)\n\nPetra: The Complete Guide to Fódlan's Wildlife!\nPetra: I have so much happiness! You are full of amazement.\nLinhardt: Heh, well, books are my field of expertise. Still, what a stroke of luck.\nPetra: Linhardt… Can I be asking you something?\nLinhardt: What's that?\nPetra: You are no longer saying I am bothering you. Instead you are helping me with my requests.\nPetra: What is the reasoning? Why am I not bothering you now?\nLinhardt: Hmm, interesting observation. I wonder why that is?\nLinhardt: You always ask me so earnestly. You seem to throw your entire being into all that you do.\nLinhardt: I guess I rather like it...working as hard as you do. On occasion, that is.\nPetra: You are liking the hard work?\nLinhardt: Yes. You inspire me to be, well, something that is not normally me.\nPetra: If you are liking it, then I will keep working hard.\nPetra: With your wisdom, I can be working even harder than before.\nPetra: That means I will be needing your wisdom from now onward.\nPetra: With my strength and your wisdom, there is nothing we can't be doing.\nLinhardt: I think you may be right. Your strength and my wisdom…\nLinhardt: That sounds like a wonderful combination._A+_null_
28_30_Linhardt: Aha, Lysithea. It's wrong to tease, yet I can hardly help myself... I know a secret. Your secret, in fact.\nLysithea: I think you mean a baseless rumor. Why are you wasting your time? And mine, for that matter.\nLinhardt: Well... It's a secret that could completely overturn what is considered common knowledge in Crest research...\nLysithea: Shut your mouth! Just...ugh. Let's go talk somewhere other than here.\n(screen briefly fades to black)\n\nLysithea: OK. Where did you hear about it?\nLinhardt: There was a sort of accident in Professor Hanneman's room...\nLysithea: I should've figured. You haven't told anyone, have you?\nLinhardt: Of course not. If someone else were to learn you have two Crests, I might lose you as a test subject.\nLysithea: Ah! Please stop talking so loudly! So what if I have two Crests? If you insist on speaking of it, please do so quietly.\nLinhardt: My intuition was correct! You do have two Crests.\nLysithea: Wait - What?! Did you just trick me?\nLinhardt: \"Trick\" is such a strong word. I think of it as testing a hypothesis. The truth is I simply made an educated guess.\nLysithea: Ugh. Well, now that I've confirmed it for you, there's not much I can do.\nLinhardt: I disagree. For example, you could tell me if you were born with them. Or is the source magical? What does it feel like to use both Crests at the same time? Is it pleasant? Painful? Euphoric?\nLysithea: Enough is enough! I am done talking about this! As though I'd speak of this to the likes of you.\nShe walks off.\nLinhardt: I understand her desire for privacy, but to refuse my request for knowledge? Well...it's rude._Linhardt: There you are, Lysithea. I've been looking for you. So I have a hypothesis about your Crests...\nLysithea: I know you're the one who sent me that \"anonymous\" letter. \"There are things we must discuss...\" Ugh, it sounded like some bizarre love letter.\nLinhardt: What? No. Of course not. However, I wonder what you would have done if it was...\nLysithea: Now I'm just confused...and grossed out.\nLinhardt: I'm sorry, but that is not the overall topic of discussion. Do pay attention.\nLysithea: Pay attention to you? As though anything you say is worth listening to. It's not like you can tell me anything I don't already know.\nLinhardt: You don't have a very positive opinion of your Crests, do you? That's why you should listen to me.\nLysithea: Um...\nLinhardt: I've dug through all my books, and there's no record of anyone being born with two Crests. You are, to be blunt, an impossible occurrence. For you to have a second Crest, it must have been forcibly implanted after birth.\nLysithea: Is that your theory, then?\nLinhardt: Yes. It is. To further the theory, if the power exists to implant a Crest, then it must be possible to remove one too. And that is the real issue at hand.\nLysithea: I... I could have one removed?\nLinhardt: That's what Hanneman is working on understanding. I'm helping him with it.\nLysithea: Professor Hanneman...\nLinhardt: Based on your reaction, it seems you want one of your Crests removed... I don't think I'd give up having two Crests if I were you.\n(Lysithea turns away from Linhardt)\n\nLysithea: Is that so? Even if you'd gone through horrifying experiments, endless trauma, and if you knew that all this pain meant you'd die very, very young... That's what you'd think? You're completely lacking in empathy, so of course you would make such a crass and foolish assumption.\n(Lysithea leaves)_Lysithea: Uh...you seem to have lined up your desserts very meticulously.\nLinhardt: What you see before you, Lysithea, is a life choice.\nLysithea: Oh, really?\nLinhardt: The most skilled pastry chef in the army has been asked to do the impossible in the heart of wartime... Source high-quality ingredients, employ advanced baking methods, and create...these two pastries.\nLysithea: Wow, you've put a lot of thought into this. May I?\nLinhardt: Of course. You can have but one though, and it should be noted that they taste completely different. I thought I'd split them between us, seeing as they were made so carefully and are so very, very special.\nLysithea: Ah. Thanks. So, what exactly is the life choice you mentioned? Also, if you are not partaking, I'll just go ahead and eat them both.\nLinhardt: Oh, no. For you see, if you eat one, you simply cannot - must not - eat the other. Should you eat both, a pair of ingredients - one in each pastry - will combine to poison you.\nLysithea: That seems unnecessarily intense. Just one won't kill me, then?\nLinhardt: Of course not. But making this choice means you will not be able to taste the second dessert...ever. No matter what I tell you, you'll never know which one tasted best. And if you were underwhelmed by your choice, you'll regret your decision forever.\nLysithea: So...I should just pick one and be done with it.\nLinhardt: But you've already chosen, haven't you? Not between the pastries but your life paths. You would gamble on the chance of living a long life, even if it meant losing your two Crests. Correct? Hence my current choice.\nLysithea: Wait - whose choice are we talking about now?\nLinhardt: A shortened lifespan doesn't necessarily mean a short life. Even with two Crests, you might live a long time. And with you around, the study of Crests will undoubtedly reach previously unimagined levels. On the other hand... Getting rid of them could help someone that I care about. Maybe. Or maybe it won't help at all. Unfortunately, one never knows until they eat the pastry. Even then, you can never taste them both.\nLysithea: Hang on, Linhardt. Do you mean to tell me you care about me? Since when?\nLinhardt: When indeed. You are someone I care about though. So much so, I wish we could be family, you and I.\nLysithea: Family?! That escalated rather quickly. Although...having more family does sound nice.\nLinhardt: Anyway, I need to be going. Oh, and feel free to eat the pastries. I made up the poison bit because I didn't know how else to say what I wished to say. And because...well, because I believe there are choices we can make where you can have both. I'll show you somehow...before the war is over.\n(Linhardt leaves)\n\nLysithea: Are you sure these aren't poisoned? Linhardt, wait! Wait!_null_null_null_
28_32_Linhardt: Ah, there it is. Just as I thought. But what is she hiding?\nMarianne: Oh, Linhardt. My apologies. I didn't mean to bother you.\nLinhardt: Ah, Marianne. You're no bother at all. In fact, you've arrived at precisely the right time.\nMarianne: Huh? The right time... for what?\nLinhardt: You have a Crest, don't you?\nMarianne: I-I don't— what are you saying?\nLinhardt: If you hide it, that just makes it more interesting. You do have one.\nMarianne: I, um... please don't tell anyone. You can't tell anyone I have a Crest. If people find out, then...\nLinhardt: What?\nMarianne: Please! My adoptive father told me to keep it a secret! And I personally don't want it known!\nLinhardt: Who said I intended to tell anyone? Your secret is safe with me. I find it fascinating that you carry the Crest of the Erased Hero—\nMarianne: Please! Stop! Don't say another word! No one should know about or even speak of my crest. Nothing good comes of it. It's even the reason my parents disappeared. This crest only brings bad luck to anyone who comes near me. Even you, Linhardt. You have to stay away.\nLinhardt: Bad luck generated by the Crest? Now that would be a discovery well worth making. What manner of bad luck do you suppose might beset me?\nMarianne: No! You shouldn't be so cavalier about something you couldn't possibly understand! I - I have to go.\nLinhardt: It's true, I don't understand ... but I very much want to._Marianne: These ones look good. I probably shouldn't pick them though...\nLinhardt: Ah, Marianne. Harvesting the crops?\nMarianne: Oh! Y-yes, Linhardt. Um... I've found which vegetables are ripe and ready, but would you mind picking them for me?\nLinhardt: Ah, see, you've mistaken me for someone who sticks his hands in the dirt.\nMarianne: I'm just afraid that if I touch them, well...\nLinhardt: Oh, I see. You're afraid that everyone who eats them will suffer bad luck?\nMarianne: Yes. It's true. I wouldn't want anybody to suffer because of me.\nLinhardt: Marianne, that's simply not the way the world works. You see - Uh... forget about it. Tell me which ones to pick.\nMarianne: Thank you so much, Linhardt.\nLinhardt: Happy to help... but I'm beat. You'll have to carry them yourself, so take them straight in, OK?\nMarianne: Um, OK.\nLinhardt: Oh, actually, before I go, do you mind if I ask you a question? I've been thinking... Isn't it more the case that your Crest brings happiness rather than bad luck?\nMarianne: Happiness? I don't understand.\nLinhardt: Yes, happiness. Because your Crest is so rare. It excites my mind, and, well... If not for your Crest, we might have never met, and I feel that would be a tremendous loss. Backbreaking as it was, I enjoyed today. I'm quite happy right now, and it's due entirely to your Crest.\nMarianne: I-I suppose so, when you put it that way. But I-\nLinhardt: It's a huge breakthrough to know that your Crest causes happiness instead of bad luck. I'd love to study it thoroughly, but only if you'd agree. Really, I just want to find a way for your crest to bring you happiness too.\nMarianne: I'm sorry, but I can't. I have to decline.\nLinhardt: I understand. May I ask one more thing though? Could you please hand me one of those vegetables?\nMarianne: I don't think that's a good idea, but if you insist.\nLinhardt: Thank you, Marianne. I think this looks like a very lucky vegetable._Linhardt: There you are, Marianne. I'd like a moment to talk.\nMarianne: Oh! Linhardt! Um, I was just on my way to pray.\nLinhardt: Hm, all right. Afterwards.\nMarianne: It's already getting late though. If you'll excuse me. Hmm.\nLinhardt: So then, you're done?\nMarianne: Linhardt?! Were you here this entire time?\nLinhardt: I was sleeping. Are you ready to talk now?\nMarianne: I suppose. My apologies for keeping you waiting.\nLinhardt: I wasn't waiting. As I said, I was sleeping. I didn't want to disrupt your prayers.\nMarianne: I see. So... what did you want to talk about?\nLinhardt: The results of my research.\nMarianne: Your... research?\nLinhardt: I intended to look into the power of your Crest from the first moment I met you. I've been feeling quite happy as of late, and I can conclude that it is due to your Crest.\nMarianne: Are you sure? That's...\nLinhardt: Or, more likely, I feel good because I've recently taken a bit of exercise.\nMarianne: Oh...\nLinhardt: Although, keeping you from finding out I was researching you was plenty of exercise on its own. Listen, Marianne. I'll tell you one thing for certain... Your Crest is not the source of anyone's bad luck.\nMarianne: ...\nLinhardt: The research on your Crest is lacking, but other Crests have been studied quite a bit. I can find no proof that a Crest can influence the lives of those who come in contact with its bearer. And frankly, transmitting bad luck via touch sounds like a crazy superstition. Don't you agree?\nMarianne: That may be true...\nLinhardt: By the way, eating the vegetables you gave me caused me no ill effects. They were delicious as ever. It may have been another story if I drank your blood... Ugh, now I'm nauseous.\nMarianne: Ugh. You're going to make us both sick!\nLinhardt: All right, all right, sorry. As I said, it is my scholarly opinion that your Crest does not cause bad luck.\nMarianne: Thank you for your reassurance. It does make me feel a little better.\nLinhardt: It's probably just that you and the people around you have had some bad days. It happens. I'm going to watch over you from now on, and if either of us has bad luck... Well, I'll look into whether it's just chance or if it's your Crest. In fact, I'll dedicate my life to it.\nMarianne: Your life? For me?\nLinhardt: Especially for you, Marianne. Don't make me spell it out..._null_null_null_
