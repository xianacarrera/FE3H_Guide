30_41_Lysithea: Honestly, what do they all take me for? I'm fine. Perfectly and completely fine. It's hardly different from daytime. I'm not scared.\n(Byleth arrives)\n\nLysithea: Ahhhhh! Guh-guh-GHOST! Uh... Hang on... Professor? Is that you? Oh, well... Good evening! Hahaha!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Where are you headed?\nChoice 2: What are you doing?\nLysithea: Oh, I left something in the dining hall, so I'm on my way to fetch it. But you don't need to come with me or anything like that. I'm fine on my own—really!\nByleth: I wasn't planning on it...\nLysithea: You weren't? Oh. Apologies for making an assumption. The truth is, everyone I come across asks if I'd like some company. They all seem to think I'll be scared wandering alone at night. So rude and presumptuous, you know? I'm perfectly capable of being on my own!\nByleth: Of course. Good evening, then.\nLysithea: Hey! Professor, wait! I...um, well... I thought it might be nice to walk and talk together to the dining hall. Shall we? To be abundantly clear, this has nothing to do with my nonexistent fear of ghosts.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'd be happy to.\nChoice 2: Actually, I'm a bit busy...\nLysithea:\nChoice 1 response: Oh, you must be bored! Fantastic, then!\nChoice 2 response: Oh, are you on patrol? You should probably patrol on over to the dining hall, then! (Byleth nods) Wonderful! After all, there's lots of very important...food stored there.\n(Lysithea and Byleth arrive at dining hall)\n\nLysithea: Do you mind, um, filling the void with some chatter? Some find silence to be a bit unsettling, after all.\nByleth: What would you have me say?\nLysithea: OK, I confess. I AM scared of ghosts! The monastery is unnerving to me at night. So can we talk about something, please? Anything! I've noticed for quite some time now—you treat all your students equally, don't you? You've never treated me differently simply because I'm younger than the others. And I've always appreciated that.\nByleth: You're younger?\nLysithea: Isn't it rather obvious? I'm roughly two to three years younger than the rest of the class. Have you not been paying close enough attention to those you teach? That's poor form for a professor... Oh! There, I've found what I was looking for! Well, I'd better be on my way now. Good night!_Lysithea: Professor, thank you for helping me with my training.\nByleth: Anytime.\nLysithea: I'd love to do this again, if possible. Your advice is always so useful. Everyone thinks you're a wonderful teacher. You account for people's weaknesses while capitalizing on their strengths. Initially I wasn't sure you paid too much attention to your students. Clearly, I was wrong. After all, were that the case, you wouldn't be capable of providing such useful feedback. I'll continue to learn and grow from your instruction, Professor. I just know it!\nByleth: You're quite determined.\nLysithea: You think I'm determined?\nByleth: Yes. You're always pushing yourself.\nLysithea: Professor, I... Thank you! You're the only one who's ever praised me like that. I mean, people are always telling me I've got a knack for magic. If you can call the power of Crests a \"knack\", they aren't wrong, per se. Though bearing two Crests isn't a gift I ever asked for... Anyhow, I've made a point to work harder than most and not rely too heavily on the power they bestow. So I find it frustrating that the only praise I seem to receive is directly related to that power. If you've noticed how hard I work, then, well... It just... It makes me very happy.\nByleth: Why do you work yourself so hard?\nLysithea: Well, you see... I... It is because I am the only child of House Ordelia. I must do all I can for my family name. I'm determined to someday be of real value to them, and that day must come soon. I can't waste any time. I don't have much of it left... Anyway, I should be going. Thank you again for your help!_Lysithea: Thank you for helping me with my training again today, Professor. I'm gonna keep at it for a while longer, so you go on ahead.\nByleth: You should get some rest.\nLysithea: I can't. Not when I'm right on the cusp of using my power to greater potential. Surely you yourself are tired. Just...don't worry about me, OK?\n(Lysithea collapses on the ground.)\n\nByleth: …\n(Lysithea awakens in the infirmary.)\n\nLysithea: I'm sorry, Professor. It was careless of me to continue, despite how fatigued I clearly was. I probably should have listened to you. Now I've made a mess of things. I can't help but feel the need to rush, in all things, constantly. You get that way when you realize...you haven't got much time.\nByleth: What do you mean?\nLysithea:\n(Verdant Wind route): I believe I've mentioned that House Ordelia was, at one time, being controlled by people from the Empire. During that time, strange people — mages, perhaps — came and performed rituals on all the youth within my family.\n(Other routes): Eighteen years ago, House Ordelia was involved in a civil conflict within the Empire. All we did was respond to a call for aid. We weren't involved politically. But once the rebellion was crushed, my family was held responsible for the aid we gave, and the Empire gained some sway over us as a result. At the time, the noble houses of the Alliance took a passive stance. No one lent aid to my family. As a result, some key officials within the family were killed, and people from the Empire were sent to replace them. Among those people were some mysterious mages. They were...unsettling, in a word. Skin pale as death. One after another, they captured and imprisoned the children of our household. They began performing terrible rituals on the children... Though it's probably more accurate to call them experiments.\nLysithea: With the Empire monitoring our every move, my parents could do nothing but watch in horror as all of this unfolded. One after another, the children died, until the only one left...was me. You know, my hair wasn't always this color. During their experiments, they'd been doing things with my blood. One morning, I awoke like this — a shock of white hair, all trace of pigment, gone. Upon seeing me, the mages were delighted. They realized that their experiments had finally succeeded. Sure enough, they ran a test and saw that two Crests coexisted within me. Losing pigment from my hair wasn't the only loss. The mages informed me that my lifespan was now greatly shortened. Five more years at most. Perhaps less.\nByleth: How awful...\nLysithea: Shortly thereafter, the mages lost interest in me, and we never saw them in the Ordelia household again. Since all that, our family has been in decline — it's challenging now even to govern our territory. After all my mother and father have suffered, I at least want them to have peace as they grow older. That is all I wish for...but I haven't much time to ensure it comes to pass.\nByleth: It's too soon to give up.\nLysithea: It's not like what's been done to me can be undone.\nByleth: Let's try to find a way to undo it.\nLysithea: Professor... The only way I can conceive of would be to remove my Crests somehow. But I don't know if that's even remotely possible. Even if it were... I wouldn't be of much use to you and the others without my Crests.\nByleth: We will find a way.\nLysithea: You sound resolved. I'll allow your resolve to bolster my own! Thank you, Professor._null_null_Lysithea: …\nLysithea: Professor, I…\nByleth: We've done what we can.\nLysithea: We have. I can feel that the Crests are no longer a part of me.\nLysithea: That must mean I'll… I mean, my body will…\nByleth: We can't say for sure, but we can hope.\nLysithea: Thank you, Professor. No matter the outcome, I feel a sense of peace.\nLysithea: I have hope, and that hope will carry me through it all.\nLysithea: You've done so much, searching for a way to remove my Crests—to save me.\nLysithea: I can't tell you how much it means to me.\nByleth: So, what will you do now?\nLysithea: I will not claim my title. House Ordelia will end with my father's generation.\nLysithea: After this, I'm going to begin preparations for our family's dissolution.\nLysithea: This will ensure that the people of our territory will not be troubled. And my parents will be able to live out their lives in peace.\nByleth: And after that?\nLysithea: A good question…\nLysithea: I hadn't considered it. But, assuming I have life left in me…\nLysithea: Would it be all right if I came back here? To…stay by your side?\nLysithea: Without my Crests, I'm not sure what all I'd be able to do for you.\nLysithea: But you have given me a new life. I want to use my time to support you however I can.\nLysithea: I just…\nByleth: Lysithea… I want you to have this.\n(Byleth presents Jeralt's ring.)\n\nLysithea: Oh! Is this… This is…\nByleth: I'll be waiting for your safe return.\nLysithea: …\nLysithea: What I said earlier about not caring what the outcome of all this is… I take it back.\nLysithea: For the longest time, I didn't think I'd be around to be a part of the future you and everyone were creating. That I had no place in it.\nLysithea: But now, I cannot fight it any longer… I do care. And I do not wish to give up on chasing that future.\nLysithea: I do not wish to die! I refuse to give up…on myself, or on our future.\nLysithea: And so…I promise to come back to you. No matter what!\nLysithea: Once I'm back…\nByleth: We will chase that future. Together.\nLysithea: Lysithea: Yes, I quite like the sound of that. Together! It is decided. We will be together forever. Living long, full lives! Count on it, my love.

30_39_Sylvain: Lysithea, I have to say you're really impressive. I respect you a lot, and I thought I should tell you.\nLysithea: Uhh, OK.\nSylvain: It's just, you know, you're four years younger than me, but you work really hard at everything. I mean, when I was your age, I wasted all my time just goofing off and doing whatever I wanted.\nLysithea: Doesn't look like much has changed for you since then. And unlike you, I don't have time to waste, so leave me be.\nSylvain: Are you going to do some extra magic training? I'd be happy to join you, if you don't mind. What do you want to start with?\nLysithea: I am absolutely disinterested in spending any time with you. What is it you want, anyway? Clearly you haven't been listening to a word I've been saying. Perhaps it's because I'm younger, you see fit to ignore me when I speak. Is that it?\nSylvain: What? No! Age has nothing to do with it. You're amazing! You're true to yourself. You know what you want and who you are. Not a lot of girls I know can say that.\nLysithea: Ah, so it isn't my age that's to blame for you breezing over my wishes. It's my gender.\nSylvain: I— what? Where did you get that idea? I'm just trying to praise your smarts and hard work and everything. It's impressive how someone so young—\nLysithea: Your lack of self-awareness is deeply troubling.\nSylvain: What I'm aware of is you trying to pick a fight. Calm down, kiddo.\nLysithea: Look. I'm really busy. Super, extremely, inordinately busy. I've got one last thing to say to you.\nSylvain: And what would that be?\nLysithea: I'm skilled with magic, and my abilities are finely honed. It's not like I need someone for target practice.\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nSylvain: No, but I do._Lysithea: Sylvain, I've been looking for you. Do you have a moment?\nSylvain: Hey, Lysithea. I was about to grab some food. Would you like to come along?\nLysithea: Actually, yes. That sounds fine.\nSylvain: Great. Let's go.\n(Screen fades briefly)\n\nSylvain: Hmm... The dining hall isn't exactly relaxing, is it? If there's a next time, I'll take you somewhere with a much better atmosphere.\nLysithea: I don't really care about the atmosphere. I just wanted to apologize.\nSylvain: Nah, I get why you told me off. There's nothing you need to apologize for.\nLysithea: Ugh, can you just shut your mouth and listen for once? Here's something you may have already picked up on... I very much dislike being treated like a child. I worked very hard to be where I am now, and such treatment makes it feel like all of that work is being ignored.\nSylvain: But I think you're a genius! And you work harder than I ever did. When I was your age...\nLysithea: Yes, you already told me all of this. Back then you were just as devoted to goofing off as you are now.\nSylvain: Ah, so I already told you that... What a perfect memory you have.\nLysithea: And there it is. You're always so quick to flatter every woman you come across. I knew that, and yet I never thought you would direct your antics at me.\nSylvain: Heh... Look, I'm sorry, OK? I know how hard you work, and I really wasn't trying to upset you. I just wanted to chat.\nLysithea: I do not mind that you wished to chat with me. In fact... you might even say I was about it. Just a bit.\nSylvain: Seriously? It sure didn't seem that way...\nLysithea: Well, it's true. Your behavior is maddening, but in retrospect, I realize that was you treating me as you do all women, rather than like a child. I wasn't thinking about it like that at the time, and so, I snapped at you. I could have perhaps approached the matter with a tad more maturity. Therefore, I would like to apologize.\nSylvain: An apology? That is not how these conversations usually turn out. There's no need for that though. Really, you'll make me blush if you keep this up. Listen, Lysithea, I want you to know that I meant every word. Even if sincerity is... difficult for me. You're as lovely as you are clever, and you have this strange charm about you. That's what I really honestly think.\nLysithea: There you go again with your false flattery...\nSylvain: I swear to you, it isn't false at all! And it's not flattery if it's the truth.\nLysithea: Say what you will ─ you're still going to have to earn my trust. Just this once, I'll cut you some slack. Don't get used to it. It's not like I can change who you are as a person.\nSylvain: Sweet and tolerant! You never cease to amaze.\nLysithea: I'll leave you with this ─ don't say things you don't mean. It makes it impossible to tell the lies from the truth. Don't come crying to me if you carry on as you have and end up with no friends.\nSylvain: Heh heh... I have to say, Lysithea, your harshness is one of those things I find so charming about you!\nLysithea: Ugh, you are exhausting. I guess the positivity is OK, though._null_null_null_null_
30_35_Lysithea: Ugh, this theory just isn’t coming together. The thought behind it is sound enough, but... Hm.\nRaphael: Hey, Lysithea. Your forehead’s all wrinkled. You look tense. Is something wrong? You know you can tell your Big Bro Raph—I mean you know you can tell me anything, right?\nLysithea: Raphael, while I appreciate your offer, I’m not so sure you’ll be much help here.\nRaphael: What does that mean? Oh, are you researching something complicated? In that case, yeah, you’re probably right. Is there something else I can help you with? I’m really good at other things. Like training!\nLysithea: I have absolutely zero interest in such things.\nRaphael: I have an idea! Do you wanna get real good at playing tag? I could teach you!\nLysithea: …\nRaphael: There’s a trick to it that most people don’t know. Like, to not get tagged and stuff. Let me show you!\nLysithea: …\nRaphael: It’s too sunny out to spend all day inside studying! C’mon, Big Bro’s gonna take you outsi—\nLysithea: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Can’t you see I’m busy?! Go bother someone else! What nerve you have, too, calling yourself “Big Bro!” Like I’m your little sister or some nonsense. Just cut the act.\nRaphael: Uhhh. Did I really say that out loud?\nLysithea: Anyway, my grades are miles better than yours. If you want to play the part of “big brother,” you’d probably benefit from studying way, way more.\nRaphael: Like I said, I’m really good at other things, just not classroom learning...\nLysithea: I can’t stand all the excuses. Clearly you’re the little kid here. You got all that? Now, don’t bother me again. Understood? Bye.\n(Lysithea leaves)\n\nRaphael: Phew! She must be going through a rebellious phase!_Lysithea: So heavy... Ugh. I think I might've borrowed one too many books this time. And I have to return them at some point— ahhh!\nRaphael: What's going on? Everything OK?!\nLysithea: Argh, just my luck...\nRaphael: Lysithea? Oh wow. Look at the mess you made.\nLysithea: Thank you for the assistance. I can take it from here.\nRaphael: Were you planning on carrying this much weight on your own?! Don't be ridiculous! You should've at least asked for help!\nLysithea: They're all books I need for my studies, and it's my own responsibility. No need to involve others.\nRaphael: I'm happy to help you carry some of them. How about half? That's fair, right?\nLysithea: No, really. I have this. I am not incapable— and I'm not a child.\nRaphael: Hahaha! As smart as you are, you sure are a silly person. I'm so tough! I'm gonna stand my ground! I don't need help from anyone! And when things don't go my way, I'm gonna act all sad and moody!\nLysithea: You... are remarkably talented at channeling me...\nRaphael: Huh? Oh, no! Sorry! I was imitating my little sister. Her name's Maya. She's way smart, but she can be pretty stubborn. You remind me of her. What I mean to say is that I want to help, so swallow your pride and ask.\nLysithea: Ugh.\nRaphael: I'll be carrying this stack of books now. Got a problem with that?\nLysithea: Yeah, yeah. You seem obstinately determined to go against my wishes.\nRaphael: All right! Is this a good spot to drop 'em?\nLysithea: Hey, what're you doing?! They need to be stacked neatly, otherwise they'll topple! This one needs to be rearranged, otherwise the rest won't fit properly!\nRaphael: Wow, talk about picky.\nLysithea: You're the one who was so insistent on helping. If you're gonna help, do it right or don't bother.\nRaphael: Fine, fine!_Lysithea: Where is that darn ladder?\nRaphael: Need help with something, Lysithea?\nLysithea: I can't find the ladder anywhere, and I need it to check out the books up on that top shelf.\nRaphael: Want me to just grab one for you?\nLysithea: No. I need to be able to dig around myself.\nRaphael: No problem! You can sit on my shoulders instead! Up you go!\nLysithea: Hang on a sec— That's not! Agh!\n(screen briefly fades to black)\n\nLysithea: I hope nobody saw that. Anyway, thank you. That was helpful. I can't believe how many fantastic books were hidden just out of reach up there. Thanks for being so patient while I rummaged.\nRaphael: No problem at all! It was my pleasure!\nLysithea: Hey, Raphael. You're always extra nice to me. Is it because I remind you of your sister, Maya?\nRaphael: Yeah. I can't help but think about her whenever I see you around. We lost our parents when she was still real little, so she never had adults around to do stuff for her. That's probably why she grew up to be the kinda kid who wants to do everything on her own.\nLysithea: That's certainly something I can relate to.\nRaphael: I keep telling her that it's OK to rely on her big bro a little bit. Like when there's stuff she can't do 'cause she's too small. She just needs to ask someone bigger to do it! I told her that she could help me when I'm having trouble with stuff too. Then we would be even.\nLysithea: Young or old, we call all help one another out. We each have our own strengths and weaknesses. Receiving help and providing help in return. It sounds so simple, really...\nRaphael: It is simple! I knew you get it!\nLysithea: I do. And I hope you understand that you can come to me for help, too, Raphael. I can't be the only one receiving aid. It makes me feel incompetent and like a kid. I hate that.\nRaphael: Hmm... All right then. You can help me clean up my room!\nLysithea: I bet it's a disaster, knowing you. I'll help you on that front, but I've got some rules on how to keep things tidy. You'll need to listen up!\nRaphael: If you could help with the actual tidying, that would probably be better. No need to bother with 'rules'. I don't really do so good with remembering the complicated stuff. Oh! I got an idea! It would be even better if you could just came by to tidy up from now on!\nLysithea: Uh...\nRaphael: If you keep helping me, then I can help you whenever you need it! No guilt!\nLysithea: Whenever I need it, huh? How long does that offer hold?\nRaphael: From now on! Like, for always! I don't know what's so difficult to understand...\nLysithea: For always sound nice. I'm fine with that._null_null_null_

But, I don’t know how I...\nLysithea: We could really use your help before things get out of hand! Come on! Hurry!\nMarianne: I...

The situation was urgent, and I’ll admit I wasn’t thinking clearly. I shouldn't have been so callous. I hurt your feelings, didn’t I?\nMarianne: No, it’s fine. I’m the one to blame.\nLysithea: Huh? But, hey, are you sure you’re all—\nMarianne: I’m the one who should apologize. All I did was get in your way. You would have made it to the training grounds much sooner if I hadn’t slowed you down.\nLysithea: Huh? Wait a second—\nMarianne: It’s all my fault. It’s always my fault. The accident was probably my fault too!\nLysithea: You’re being so...negative. I don’t know what to say..._Lysithea: Marianne! Do you mind if I ask you about something?\nMarianne: Yes?\nLysithea: It’s about animal behavior. Among us all, you surely know the most about animals.\nMarianne: …\nLysithea: I’ve read that in outdoor battles, wild animals can sometimes cause unexpected confusion. What do you think would be the best strategy to... Umm... Are you listening, Marianne?\nMarianne: I was listening, I just don’t think I can really—\nLysithea: For crying out loud! Why do you always have to admit defeat before even giving yourself a chance?!\nMarianne: My advice would probably just put everyone in danger. You’d be better off without me.\nLysithea: This is beyond ridiculous. You’re impossible! You seem convinced you’re some sort of cursed being, destined to bring doom and gloom to anyone you encounter!\nMarianne: Well...\nLysithea: Why do you have such a terrible opinion of yourself? How can you possibly be so dense?!\nMarianne: I just—\nLysithea: Just nothing! Now you listen to me for a moment. I can see that you have some deep-seated turmoil that you struggle with. I’ll have you know I have quite a few issues of my own. Perhaps more grave than yours, if you can imagine.\nMarianne: R-Really?\nLysithea: Yes. But I’m not the only one who has such troubles to contend with. Everyone does. That’s why it’s so important to maintain a positive outlook and do what we can. Each time we find the light in the dark, we grow, bit by bit. And without growth, what’s the point in carrying on?\nMarianne: Lysithea... I envy your confidence and strength.\nLysithea: Don’t envy me. Instead, just choose to find the positive, won’t you?\nMarianne: Yes. Well, maybe someday...\nLysithea: The time is now! This is your moment!\nMarianne: Oh! OK!\nLysithea: That’s more like it. Now to start, why don’t you help me out by answering my questions about wild animals?\nMarianne: I’ll certainly try my best._null_null_null_null_
