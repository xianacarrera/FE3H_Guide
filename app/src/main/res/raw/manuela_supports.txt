31_41_(Byleth knocks on Manuela's door)\n\nManuela: I... Who... Oh, settle down and stop with the knocking. I'll be there in two shakes.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You were sleeping.\nChoice 2: I'd like a word.\nManuela: Oh, dear... Professor? Is that you? I...just a moment. What should I do? I can't open the door in this state... Manuela, you simply must quit...oversleeping. Hold on. Where are my clothes? I can't even find my— Where in blazes is my underwear?! Oh, I— What is my dressing robe caught on? I can't tie this properly! It's not even covering— Oh, Manuela... This will have to do...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Are you OK?\nChoice 2: I can hear you.\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: I-I'm fine. Just... Just hold on a moment.\nChoice 2 response: Ugh... I would hope, Professor, that you have the decorum to pretend you've heard nothing. Anyway, I'll be just another moment. Patience, please.\n(Manuela finishes making herself presentable, and comes into the hall.)\n\nManuela: Ahh, hello. Sorry to have kept you waiting. So... What do you want?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That took a while.\nChoice 2: What were you doing?\nManuela: Excuse me? You had a reason for coming here, I assume. I've put a lot of time and effort into making it possible to talk with you, you know...\nByleth: Sorry.\nManuela: No, you've done nothing wrong. Let's just say I'm not having a good day. Actually, I didn't have a good night... Never mind! What did you want, anyway?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: About last night...\nChoice 2: I have a message from a knight...\nManuela: You heard from him? The fella from last night?! Huh. What did he have to say?\nByleth: He said, \"We will never go out together again.\"\nManuela: Yeah... Figures. Kind of saw it coming, actually. That's why I came back to my room and went to be. To get over it. Thank you...for checking in on me. Was that all you wanted? Well then, good night.\nByleth: Sleep well._Manuela: Professor! A pleasure to see you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Why are you here?\nChoice 2: Are you praying?\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: I was here for confessional... Confessing my foolishness.\nChoice 2 response: I've never been very good at praying. I was here to confess my foolishness.\nManuela: While I'm at it, may I confess something to you too?\nByleth: No need to ask. Go ahead.\nManuela: I realize what a burden I've been. On you, I mean. After every break-up, I neglect my work. And I know how that affects you. I'm completely worthless as a woman. Can you imagine how that feels? I'm going to be single for the rest of my life. I just know it. You think so too, don't you?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Yes.\nChoice 2: No.\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: I'd rather you disagree, even if you don't mean it. Lie to a woman when she's down and out, yeah?\nChoice 2 response: Really? So, if I couldn't find anybody else, you'd marry me? Oh, don't worry. I can tell by the look on your face you didn't mean it.\nManuela: What's wrong with me? It's not my looks. I'm still gorgeous. Or am I? Be honest. Do I look old? No... Not possible. I'm the songstress who swept the Empire off its feet... Men professed their love for me hourly! It can't be my looks.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You look just fine.\nChoice 2: You're attractive.\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: You're right! Although, \"just fine\" is a bit... Well, it's better to be attractive than \"just fine.\"\nChoice 2 response: I knew I was right! I'd be in real trouble if I weren't this beautiful.\nManuela: Oh no. If the problem isn't my looks—and they are not the problem—then it must be...what? My personality?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I...\nChoice 2: Your personality is fine.\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: I know you're trying to find a way to say it gently. But you think there's a problem, don't you?\nChoice 2 response: A girl can tell a lie when she hears one. You think there's a problem, don't you?\nManuela: I suppose I can be a bit...unkempt. I do have a short temper, and I may be a little lazy... Sometimes. But I've always heard fellas, you know, like a woman with a few flaws. Seems to me, there are plenty of flawed girls who have landed themselves a good man. So maybe...my trouble is I'm not imperfect enough. Do you think I could use a few more flaws?\nByleth: No.\nManuela: (blushing)Are you saying I'm perfect as I am? Come now. You'll make me blush..._Manuela: …So I said, \"Two can play at that game!\" I told him, \"A smalltime, little weasel like you oughta be begging me for attention!\" Oh, it gets me so mad. So worked up! Why aren't there any men around here who understand what a catch I am? Come to think of it... You've always been nice to me. I mean, you listen to all my problems... I feel like I can really trust you. I don't have that kind of thing with a lot of people.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're a close friend.\nChoice 2: I'm sorry I can't help...\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: Right, I got it. I knew you'd say we were just friends.\nChoice 2 response: Just... Let's stop there, OK? You don't need to say anything else.\nManuela: I'd like to maybe talk about this once the war is over. Once we're all safe. All right, enough of this moping around! What we need is a change of mood! We've still got a lot to do together. When I think about that, what are one or two men?\nManuela: …\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What's wrong?\nChoice 2: Calm down.\nManuela:\nChoice 1 response: n/a\nChoice 2 response: I can't stay calm when I'm like this!\nManuela: What's wrong is—it's not just one or two men. It's more like one hundred men! Maybe even two hundred! More! I'm... I'm completely... Ugh! I can't get out of this mood! Actually, I've got an idea. Exercise will help! I'm going to the training ground. Come on and give me a hand! Gonna work my anger out on one hundred training dummies. Maybe two hundred if we got 'em._null_null_Manuela: Oh... Are you sure you should be here? There must be tons of young girls falling over themselves just to get near a hero like you. Or are you not interest in such attention?\nByleth: Not really.\nManuela: What?! Not looking for romance, then? So that's why you never gave in, no matter how many times I tried... Listen. I get it. No need to explain anything. It's better this way. It means I wasn't the problem.\nByleth: You're wrong.\nManuela: Wait. Am I the problem? I suppose if I had some charm, maybe you would have fallen for me. Oh... Why does this always happen to me?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I want to get married.\nChoice 2: I'm in love.\nManuela: I'm not surprised. You can probably have your pick...\n(Byleth presents Jeralt's ring to Manuela)\n\nByleth: I adore you, Manuela. Will you marry me?\nManuela: W-what…\nManuela: …\nManuela: Have you gotten me confused with someone else?\nByleth: Of course not.\nManuela: Look, you don't need to take pity on me, OK? Or... That's not it, is it? I can see it in your eyes. Nobody's looked at me that way in a long, long time. I sound like a schoolgirl, but this is the moment I've always dreamed of. So, of course I'm going to mess it up by not knowing how to answer.\nByleth: Will you have your answer soon?\nManuela: Just...give me a minute to compose myself. OK... Come on, Manuela... Oooh... That's better. So my answer... Yes! Yes, I would love to marry you!\nManuela: I'm a complete mess, and I'll be a massive pain to you from now on... But in exchange for the trouble, I promise to give you all of my love. So don't let me down, you hear? You know... Until this moment, I didn't realize how much my heart longed to call you my own. I want to love you, and to be loved by you. I want...to share my life with you. And you really like that idea? (Manuela giggles slightly) Oh! Oh, goodness! Oh, I just giggled. Maybe I'm not as old as I tell myself... Or maybe you just make me feel good about myself, my darling.

But if that's how you see it, maybe there is no hope for me.\nChoice 2 response: Really? So, maybe there's still hope for me... Who am I kidding? I've known for years how hopeless I am.\nManuela: What's wrong with me? It's not my looks. I'm still gorgeous. Or am I? Be honest. Do I look old? No... Not possible.

31_39_Manuela: Ugh... My head. Where? Why am I here instead of the infirmary? When did I? Oh boy.\nSylvain: How are you feeling, Professor Manuela?\nManuela: Sylvain? What do you need at this hour?\nSylvain: You don't remember? Well, you collapsed in the infirmary, and–\nManuela: That doesn't sound like me. Wait, no... I remember. The truth is, something sad happened, so I did what I always do to forget my troubles...\nSylvain: Anyway, I found you passed out on the floor, helped you up, then carried you back here.\nManuela: And what were you doing in the infirmary late at night? Not bringing a girl there, I hope.\nSylvain: No... Nope. I was definitely alone. I just, ya know, I just had a bad feeling, and I decided to look around to see if anyone needed my help.\nManuela: Ugh, my poor head...\nSylvain: Are you all right? Here, have some water.\nManuela: What a thoughtful young man you are. You're a real gentleman compared to that jerk who just–\nSylvain: That good-for-nothing guy who strung you along, whispered sweet nothings in your ear, then shattered your heart beyond repair? I agree. He's a jerk.\nManuela: Oh no! Did I...say those things to you?\nSylvain: Actually, your version had more details. Very detailed details.\nManuela: Oh dear.\nSylvain: You know, Professor, you're a good catch. It's a shame that you've had no luck with men. You need a guy like me–somebody who sees your beauty and appreciates how tender you are, emotionally...and how much love you have to give.\nManuela: You're a smooth talker even when you don't mean what you say. I'm going to change, so shoo, OK?\nSylvain: Sure, sure, I can take a hint. Rest up, Manuela.\nManuela: Thank you, Sylvain. I'm going to try and get some sleep.\n(Sylvain leaves)\n\nManuela: Did he just call me Manuela and not professor? That sly little– Although... Hmmm. Me? With Sylvain? Now there's a crazy thought._Manuela: I must admit. That Sylvain is quite handsome... And it doesn't hurt that he's heir to a noble family. I could get used to that kind of life. The age difference bothers me a bit, but I'm sure it would be fine after a few years. At first it was hard to imagine myself with him, but now that I've thought about it, maybe—\nManuela: Speak of the devil. I think that's him over there.\n(screen fades to show Sylvain speaking with a girl)\n\nTown Girl: Ugh, what a jerk! He was playing around with me that whole time!\nSylvain: You know, you're a good catch. It's a shame that you've had no luck with men. You need a guy like me—somebody who sees your beauty and appreciates how tender you are, emotionally...and how much love you have to give.\nTown Girl: What? No way! What are you saying? I can't even tell if you're being honest...\nSylvain: Do I look dishonest? Are these the eyes of a guy who is just playing around?\nTown Girl: No... I... I suppose not. Would you like to go somewhere a little more quiet?\nSylvain: As long as it's just the two of us and the only subject is love, I'll follow you anywhere.\n(screen fades back to Manuela)\n\nManuela: OK. That was just...repulsive. He is insincerity personified. No way I'd ever fall for that. He is handsome...and does come from good stock... But, no. I can't imagine we'd have a bright future together. I suppose the goddess does not give with both hands, does she?\nManuela: …\nManuela: Wait. Could that mean because of my looks and my singing voice... That I'll never find true love?\nManuela: Please, Goddess, I'm begging you!_null_null_null_null_
31_37_Seteth: Manuela. A moment?\nManuela: Oh, hello, Seteth. I must apologize, but I am quite busy. Perhaps we could talk another time?\nSeteth: I have already confirmed that you have no urgent business. I would like to hear your explanation now.\nManuela: My explanation? For what?\nSeteth: Allow me to be more specific. Where were you, and what were you doing, last night?\nManuela: Oh, my dear Seteth. You must relax that worried brow. Those forehead creases will ruin your beauty.\nSeteth: Just answer the question, please.\nManuela: What question is that? The one you already know the answer to? Last night, I had a bit of fun, and a bit of drink. Less of one and more of the other, sure. But...\nSeteth: How much you drink is not my concern. But you are an adult who is tasked with the supervision of children. You should not be causing trouble for the students. It is unacceptable for you to expose them to your disgraceful behavior. Even more so to impose upon them the labor of cleaning up your mess.\nManuela: Oh, don't oversell it. All they did was walk with me back to my room.\nSeteth: From what I hear, you had to be carried.\nManuela: I'd like to think I'd remember that. If it happened— and it probably didn't—it's not as if I'm heavy. Nobody hurt themselves. Did they? Come on, Seteth! Loosen up. If you're so worried about how I'll behave, why don't you join me for a drink sometime? I mean, I only get in trouble when I drink alone...\nSeteth: If it will help to improve your behavior, I would not object to accompanying you from now on.\nManuela: Well, that sounds just delicious. What are you doing tonight around—\nSeteth: But first, I will lecture you on all of the intricacies of proper behavior in the supervision of children. And until I am done, you will not drink a drop of alcohol. If you agree to those conditions, I will join you. I will even drink with you. Alcohol has little effect on me.\nManuela: That is just... You know, getting lectured by you is, well, I think the word is \"torture.\" Yes. That's it. Torture. And I won't have it. I'm going to go get a drink and try to forget this ever happened.\nSeteth: How is it that you imagine yourself the tortured one?_Manuela: …\nSeteth: It seems I am not the only one here. Manuela?\nManuela: Oh! Seteth. Hello.\nSeteth: This is quite the surprise. I would not expect to find you here outside of ordinary prayer time.\nManuela: Praying? No, no. I was just...resting. Whenever I'm in the infirmary, I simply cannot get out of doing work. I need a place to sit and close my eyes.\nSeteth: There is no need to hide it. It is obvious you were praying quite solemnly just now.\nManuela: No, I was— Oh, I was just enjoying some old memories. That's all. In fact, I was just thinking about when my parents first brought me here as a child. I wandered off from my parents because I heard a beautiful voice. It was a woman. Singing. Somewhere just out of sight. I began to sing along, hoping she would hear me and that we might meet. I never found her, whoever she was. Yet it was she who taught me I could sing.\nSeteth: Interesting. I had never heard that. But I suppose, if you were only a child, this would be before I arrived at Garreg Mach. In any case, if that singing voice helped you find your way, then that is a wonderful thing.\nManuela: I've never told anyone else, but I believe it was the goddess I heard. And that day, she gifted me my singing voice. And I thank the goddess for leading me back here after I left the opera company.\nSeteth: You know, when you speak of the goddess in this way, it is as though you are an entirely different person. If you were to behave that way more in your daily life, I would have a much higher opinion of you.\nManuela: That's very sweet coming from you, Seteth. Should I take that to mean that you like your ladies pious and respectable?\nSeteth: One little compliment and you completely lose control of yourself. What am I to do with you?\nManuela: Oh, it's a joke. Look, I'm just no good at serious conversations. Although I would be lying if I said I wasn't interested in knowing what kind of woman does get your attention.\nSeteth: As thanks for the touching tale you have shared, I will satisfy your curiosity just this once. My preferred woman is kind, quiet, and proper. But above all else, she is straightforward and honest.\nManuela: Quiet? Proper?! There's no need to be cruel, Seteth!_Seteth: …\nManuela: Seteth?\nSeteth: Hello, Manuela. Is something the matter?\nManuela: You surprised me, is all. Though not as surprised as you, when you found me here before. I've never seen you offering up prayers so solemnly.\nSeteth: I suppose I do typically make an effort to come here when no one else is around. Many look to me for guidance. I do not wish to disturb anyone's prayers with my own. But I did not come here only to pray.\nManuela: Really? Then what were you doing?\nSeteth: I was swearing an oath to Saint Cethleann. She is a special figure to me. It's become part of my routine to swear this oath before her likeness. More than any other, she wishes for a peaceful world. I believe it is my duty to grant her wish. She is a very special figure to me. That is why I swear my oaths to her likeness. She wished, more than any other, for a peaceful world. I will grant her that wish, at any cost.\nManuela: I had no idea you held such a passionate secret devotion, Seteth. The legends of Saint Cethleann do depict her as a kind, proper, and honorable woman... And she was so gentle and quiet. Really kept to herself. It's no wonder you're infatuated with her.\nSeteth: I t-think you may have misunderstood me.\nManuela: It must be very lonely to be so in love with someone from the distant past.\nSeteth: She is very special to me, yes. But not in that way.\nManuela: You don't have to hide it from me, Seteth. I can keep a secret. But people from the past are gone. No matter how much you care for her, she can't love you back. Now then, if you turned your eyes to me...I could respond to your deepest, most powerful feelings.\nSeteth: You are completely mistaken!_Seteth: Manuela. About what we discussed earlier...with regard to Saint Cethleann. I feel the need to correct your misapprehensions.\nManuela: Oh, I won't expose your passion to the light of day. I told you I can keep a secret.\nSeteth: That's not it at all! How can I make you see... I suppose there is no other way. Allow me to tell you a very old story.\nManuela: What kind of story? Is it about your past? Because there's a story I could enjoy hearing.\nSeteth: I once had a wife. She passed from this world, a very long time ago.\nManuela: …\nSeteth: She was wise, kind of heart, and always smiling. A most wonderful woman. Not long after we married, we were blessed with a child. A girl.\nManuela: You had a wife and a daughter? Why would you have kept that secret?\nSeteth: To protect my daughter. That has been my foremost concern, ever since I had the misfortune to lose my wife. It is my daughter who resembles Saint Cethleann. That is why I make my oath to this statue.\nManuela: Hmm... Your story doesn't sound right to me. I don't mind saying it.\nSeteth: Why is that?\nManuela: When you talked about your ideal woman before, your description was almost exactly Saint Cethleann. Now you're telling me your daughter is a perfect match?\nSeteth: It is not an exact resemblance. My daughter, for instance, is neither proper nor quiet. In any case, even in matters of love, an ideal seldom lives up to reality. That is the way of the world.\nManuela: Do it again! Say \"the way of the world\" with a serious face! You're so stern and proper, but you really can be quite funny. I love a man who can make me laugh.\nSeteth: My wife used to say the same thing. I never quite understood what was so funny.\nManuela: I sound like your late wife? Don't tell me... I actually resemble her, don't I? Mirror image, I bet.\nSeteth: Absolutely not. Though... No. Unthinkable.\nManuela: The way you say it, I suppose I must resemble her a little. Well, isn't that an honor. Say, Seteth. Have you ever considered remarrying? You know, just so you're not alone?\nSeteth: It is not a thought that has ever crossed my mind. I have been too preoccupied with fatherhood.\nManuela: It's been a long time since your wife passed, right? You should start thinking about it. There could be someone who finds you handsome. Someone close by. Maybe even right in front of you.\nSeteth: Whatever you said just now, I didn't quite hear. But to remarry—I'd never even considered it an option until you brought it up just now. My daughter will not want to remain by my side forever. Perhaps it is time I thought about it. I suppose my daughter would not have wished for me to remain alone forever.\nManuela: I'd be happy to help you mull it over, if you like. How about tonight? We could go out for a drink...\nSeteth: Are we back to this again? Oh, very well. Just see that you do not drink too much. I would rather not have to carry you home._A+_null_
