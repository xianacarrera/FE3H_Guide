I suppose you came by to pray too?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's right.\nChoice 2: Just passing by.\nMarianne:\nChoice 1 response: I see. That's why I'm here too.\nChoice 2 response: I see. That's why I'm here.\nByleth: What were you praying for?\nMarianne: Oh, um. Nothing specific. I only call upon the goddess to give thanks, or perhaps to ask for protection. Anyhow, I should be on my way.\nByleth: Do you have a moment to chat?\nMarianne: Um. OK...\nMarianne: ...\nMarianne: I'm sorry. I don't really know what to say. I'm not very good at talking to people. The truth is, I didn't interact with people too often before I came here.\nByleth: Why is that?\nMarianne: Oh, uhm, no particular reason. I'm simply not very good at it. That's just how I am.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Don't worry about it.\nChoice 2: I'm sorry to have disturbed you.\nMarianne:\nChoice 1: Ah! Um. Thank you.\nChoice 2: No! No need to apologize.\nMarianne: I'm sorry. You shouldn't waste your time worrying about me. Please, just ignore me. I, um, have to be going now. Good-bye, Professor!\nByleth: ..._Marianne: Um...Professor! There's something I need to say...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm happy to listen.\nChoice 2: This isn't like you.\nMarianne: Thank you. How should I put this... I don't seem to be getting along with everyone. I don't contribute much either. Am I a nuisance to you, Professor? If so, I'll leave. Of course, my adoptive father may not understand, but if I must....\nByleth: Your adoptive father?\nMarianne: Oh, my adoptive father is one of the new nobles of the Alliance. His territory is to the north. He was a distant relative who took me in after my parents vanished. He's blessed with great drive and ambition. Some may go so far as to call it avarice. He wishes to marry me off to a powerful noble. That's why he sent me to the academy. If I left now, I'm sure he'd have a strong opinion about it. Ah, sorry. I strayed away from the topic. I'm not good at telling stories either.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I understand.\nChoice 2: You were saying?\nMarianne: Ah, good. I'm glad. So, as I was saying... Are you sure I'm not bothering you, Professor?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're no bother at all.\nChoice 2: I'm not complaining.\nMarianne:\nChoice 1 response: Oh! I'm so grateful to hear you say that. What I'm trying to say is...you should keep your distance. I'm more trouble than I'm worth.\nChoice 2 response:\nByleth: I won't agree to that.\nMarianne: You only say that because you don't know the real me. I'm sorry. I have to go!\nByleth: ..._\t\t\tA Support if paralogue is completed\nMarianne: Dear Goddess, I ask for guidance...\nMarianne: ...\nMarianne: Professor. You're always watching over me, aren't you?\nByleth: Of course.\nMarianne: I've spent my entire life avoiding people so I wouldn't have to expose them to this horrible burden of a crest. My father was born with it as well. He's the one who told me to avoid others as much as possible. He said it would be the cause of great unhappiness to myself and everyone around me... After some time, I was only truly comfortable opening up to animals and the goddess. Do you remember the time you asked what it was I prayed for?\nByleth: Thanks and protection?\nMarianne: Yes, but that wasn't the case.\nMarianne: Back then, I felt that my life served no purpose and that I was nothing more than a burden. In truth, I was begging the goddess to take me to her. That was my daily prayer...but now I fear the idea of dying and being left alone. I have friends who accept me for who I am now, in spite of my Crest. And I have you watching over me. I've finally learned to accept the kindness and warmth of others. It's because of you, Professor. Because of you, I've decided to live.\nByleth: ...\nMarianne: I'm sorry to have worried you, but I'm alright now. I'm still not ready to tell everyone about my Crest, but I feel that the burden of my curse has been lifted. Even if I'm separated from you or any of my friends...the memories I've made here will give me the strength to continue on!\nByleth: You should look to the future instead of the past.\nMarianne: Um...\nByleth: From now on, we'll look to the future.

I really need to speak with you, but I can come back if now is not a good time.\nByleth: No, now is fine.\nMarianne: Thank you. You've always been so accepting of me. You've never rejected me for my flaws. You have given me the strength and courage to look forward to my future. But I won't know what to do with myself when the war has ended. When I'm gone, will I keep moving forward or back?\nByleth: What do you want to do?\nMarianne: Well, my adoptive father wants me to return home right away. Though he put all that talk of marrying me off to a powerful noble on hold...for now. Apparently I'm being hailed as a hero back home. Can you imagine that? Me, a hero! And now my family wants me by their side so they can flaunt my status about town...how silly. Even so, it is nice that my relationship with my adoptive father has improved. It is starting to feel as though I am a true daughter to him at last.\nByleth: Will you return home as requested?\nMarianne: No. I've been considering what would be the best course for my future, and...\nMarianne hands Byleth a ring\n\nMarianne: Well, here! Please, won't you take this?\nByleth: ...\nMarianne: I'm sorry for surprising you with this so suddenly. In truth, I've surprised even myself. It's unthinkable that someone who spent their entire life avoiding people could offer you a ring...But who I am now, it's all thanks to you. You've shown me a strength I didn't know I could possess. I wanted you to see how far I've come, and how much I've grown...I guess...I wanted you to see me show a little bravery. I'm not asking you to marry me here and now...That would...be a bit much, perhaps. Maybe we can just think of this as a promise...that you will always be in my heart.\nByleth: Marry me, Marianne.\nMarianne: What?! Really? You would want to marry me? Even with all of my flaws?\nByleth: I love you just as you are.\nMarianne: You know...\nTransition to S-support CG\n\nMarianne: I'm stronger now, but I can grow even more if you stay by my side. I'll do everything in my power to support you... and I hope you will continue to support me as well! I...I love you. So very deeply. Thank you for giving me the world.

32_39_Sylvain: Hello, Marianne. All done for the day?\nMarianne: Oh, Sylvain. Yes, I was just heading back to my quarters.\nSylvain: Well then, my timing couldn't be better. I was just heading into town, and I thought maybe you'd like to join me?\nMarianne: Um, I don't think I should.\nSylvain: I heard a story once about a beautiful maiden who was locked up in a monastery day and night. She was held prisoner by her own fear of the outside world. Then a brave knight set the girl free and took her to town where they drank tea and talked for hours. So, my fair maiden...\nMarianne: Please, you should not waste your time on me. Besides, my adoptive father requested that I not stray too far from the monastery.\nSylvain: Margrave Edmund wants to keep you locked up, huh? I've heard he's...let's call it ambitious. Well, just tell him who I am. I think he'd approve. I'm heir to House Gautier, one of the most prominent families in the Kingdom. I've got a Crest, I've got money, and I'm stunningly handsome. What's that face for, Marianne? Was it the handsome thing? I can see how that might have been a bit much.\nMarianne: I...I don't really know you all that well, but I don't think it makes a difference. I mean, it doesn't really matter to me that you have a Crest.\nSylvain: Oh, no—no—no. I didn't mean you should find my Crest impressive. I meant your family would, and— You know what? Maybe I should start over.\nMarianne: If you're going into town, please just go without me.\nSylvain: Oh. OK. I've got to get going anyway. Places to be, ya know. Well, this is me going...\nMarianne: ...\nSylvain: But remember...should you ever need me, I will forever be your knight, my maiden.\nMarianne: I wonder what he meant by that..._Sylvain: Hello, Marianne.\nMarianne: ...\nSylvain: Won't you at least tell me why you're avoiding me? It hurts. It really does.\nMarianne: I'm not avoiding you. I'm just not very good at talking to people in general.\nSylvain: I told you I'm on your side, and I meant it. I'm guessing you don't much like talking about Crests. Call it a hunch.\nMarianne: Well, um...\nSylvain: I'm the same way, ya know. The value of my life has always been dictated by the damn thing. It's not fair to have your worth determined by something you can't control. Growing up in House Gautier taught me that the hard way. What do you believe determines a person's value? I like to think it's a person's smile.\nMarianne: Huh? Their smile?\nSylvain: A smile, it tells you who someone is. Are they fake or sincere? It also makes you feel stronger when you smile. My smile helps me focus and set free all of that power I never asked for. Hm, I wonder... Try it out, Marianne! Be strong-willed, and put everything you've got into your smile.\nMarianne: Smile. Be strong-willed... How's this?\nSylvain: Yeesh, that's a terr—rrific first try...if a bit stiff. Lift the corners of your lips just a bit. Oh, I know! Try saying, \"cheese!\"\nMarianne: Ch-cheese?\nSylvain: Hey, that was good! It might feel a bit unnatural, but you'll get used to it soon enough.\nMarianne: Cheese... Are you sure this will make me stronger?\nSylvain: Guaranteed. It's a great smile, you know. Let's go to town and show it off. If you lift your eyes from the ground, you'll see that the world has all sorts of amazing things to offer. The more you realize that, the more you'll smile.\nMarianne: I'll think about it...\nSylvain: Please, don't let me pressure you. If you don't want to go, I understand.\nMarianne: It's not that I don't like going into town. I'm just eager to get back to my room. I want to go practice my smile. If I keep practicing, maybe someday I'll be ready to go into town with you.\nSylvain: Oh yeah? That sounds great. I can't wait to see your best smile._null_null_null_null_
32_35_Marianne: ...\nRaphael: Hey, Marianne! Whatcha eating? Mind if I join you? I’m starving!\nMarianne: Huh? Oh. Um.\nRaphael: All my favorite dishes are on the menu today! I might have grabbed too much. You want some?\nMarianne: No, thanks. I—\nRaphael: All you’ve got on your plate are leaves! Are you sure that’ll fill you up?\nMarianne: I-I’m done eating now. I have to go.\nRaphael: Huh? You’re already done eating? But there’s still food on your plate! Hey! Marianne! Huh. Maybe she’s not feeling well. I should probably go check on her later.\n(Scene Transition)\n\nMarianne: Oh, is that so? I’m so happy you found all of that food! A little grey starling told me that you can find berries if you fly out towards the mountains.\nRaphael: Oh! I found Marianne! I didn’t know she spent her time here. It sounds like she’s talking to someone...\nMarianne: What‘s that? You want to try some nectar from the flowers in the greenhouse? That might be tricky. I guess you could try it if I’m already there, otherwise you might get locked in.\nRaphael: Hey, Marianne! Who’re you talking to?\nMarianne: Eeek!\nRaphael: Huh? Oh, the birdie flew off...\nMarianne: Y-yes, it looks like he has. What are you doing here, Raphael?\nRaphael: You were acting a little strange when we were eating earlier, so I wanted to check on you. I was worried.\nMarianne: Uh, that’s sweet of you, but... I’m fine.\nRaphael: Are you sure? Well, that’s good to hear. As long as— Wait a minute! Were you just talking to a bird?\nMarianne: Excuse me?!\nRaphael: Hah! I knew it! You can talk to birds! I’m right, aren’t I?\nMarianne: Ah, um... yes.\nRaphael: That’s incredible! This place is full of interesting folks, but I didn’t think anyone spoke birdie!\nMarianne: No, that’s not it. This bird just happened to be... speaking human.\nMarianne leaves\n\nRaphael: Amazing! I hope I get to meet a bird who speaks human one day._Marianne: Is that... Raphael?\nRaphael: Yeah, yeah. I get it, but you can't be so picky. You need some meat in your diet! I don't know if you can eat human food, but bug meat might be good for you. That's right, you need to eat plenty of bug meat if you want to get big and strong like me! No more sweets for you!\nMarianne: What?! He's talking to a bird!\nRaphael: Huh? Is someone there?\nMarianne: Um.\nRaphael: Oh! Marianne! You're right on time! This little birdie was telling me that he misses you and — Ah, oh! Aww. It flew off.\nMarianne: It appears so.\nRaphael: Why do you think birds fly away when there's more than one person around? Birds never seem to stay put unless I'm alone.\nMarianne: Birds are very cautious creatures. They tend to fly away when they're startled.\nRaphael: You mean they're afraid of loud noises?! Oops! That was probably too loud for the birds. C'mon Raphael. Keep it down. How's this? Do you think we'd be able to talk to the birds together like this? I still haven't met a bird that can speak human. I was hoping you could introduce me.\nMarianne: Huh? I thought you were just talking to one?\nRaphael: I was mostly talking at him, not to him. He just said \"chirp chirp\" and stuff like that. I had no idea what he was talking about. I don't think he understood me either.\nMarianne: Huh...\nRaphael: Marianne, you always know which birds understand what you're saying, right? Next time you find a bird who understands you, I hope you let me know so I can join the conversation!\nMarianne: Now what am I supposed to do?_Raphael: Marianne! Come here, quick!\nMarianne: Oh! Wh-what's wrong, Raphael?\nRaphael: It's that bird you were talking to! I just found him!\n(Scene transition)\n\nRaphael: See? Right there on the lower branch! That's gotta be him, but he looks a little sad for some reason.\nMarianne: You're right. Um, do you mind if I handle this? Hello there, Mr. Bird. How do you do? Hmm... Yes, I see. I see. So your food supply is—\nRaphael: Food?! I got it!\nMarianne: I completely understand. I have seen more people and birds foraging for berries lately. It would be ideal if those berries were growing in another forest nearby. Then you wouldn't have to—\nRaphael: Are you hungry, Mr. Bird? I got just what you need!\nMarianne: Are those... bugs?! Yuck!\nRaphael: Look at him go! He's loving it! He's gonna get so big and strong after this!\nMarianne: That was... disgusting. But how did you know he was hungry?\nRaphael: I could tell by looking at him. He looked hungry and weak. More importantly, I saw what you did! That bird wasn't speaking human, so you gotta understand birdese! I knew it!\nMarianne: Oh. About that. I'm sorry, Raphael, but I need to tell you the truth. I can sort of understand what animals are thinking when I look at them, but I can't speak to them. I'm sorry for leading you on.\nRaphael: Oh... I see. What about me, then? Can you tell what I'm thinking when you look at me?\nMarianne: I, um. Uh... no, Raphael. I can't.\nRaphael: Well, of course not. You're not even looking at me! You gotta look at my eyes!\nMarianne: Ah! Nope, still can't do it!\nRaphael: I guess I just gotta tell you. I'm thinking it would be nice if you talked to me the way you talk to animals.\nMarianne: What do you mean?\nRaphael: Whenever you talk to animals, you seem happy and friendly! I just wish you'd talk to me like that too.\nMarianne: I'm so sorry, Raphael. I didn't know, I—\nRaphael: What if I try this? Cheep cheep, chirree-chir-chidoo!\nMarianne: What the—? Hahaha!\nRaphael: Whoa! I've never heard you laugh before! I should've talked to you in birdese sooner!\nRaphael: Cheep-chirrah, cheep-lee-woo, tweetle-dee!\nMarianne: Hahaha! Sorry, I didn't quite catch that one.\nRaphael: I said you gotta eat bugs to grow big and strong, just like Mr. Bird!\nMarianne: Ah! I think I'll have to pass!_null_null_null_
