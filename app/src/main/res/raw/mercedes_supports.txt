33_41_Mercedes: Good evening, Professor. Returning from work, I take it?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's right.\nChoice 2: I'm still working.\nMercedes:\nChoice 1 response: I commend you for working so late into the evening. All of my days at the academy are enriching, thanks to you.\nChoice 2 response: My goodness! It's so late in the evening. That must be exhausting.\nMercedes: Try not to overtax yourself, all right? I'm concerned for your health. We wouldn't want you to wear yourself out. The goddess won't smite you if you rely on others for help, you know.\nByleth: Even so...\nMercedes: Listen here, Professor. You might not like what I'm about to say. To be perfectly honest, I had my doubts when I first met you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That's surprising.\nMercedes: I don't want me to think less of me for saying this, but here we are.\nChoice 2: Why's that?\nMercedes: At first, I thought you seemed too young to be a professor. It is unusual, you have to admit. Yet, you seemed very composed and mature, despite your age. You're strong-willed, encouraging, and you go to great lengths to ensure that everyone is cared for. But it almost feels like you're trying too hard to be a perfect role model for your students.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm not trying too hard.\nChoice 2: It comes with the territory.\nMercedes: If that's how you feel, I can't disagree. But I think it's necessary to give yourself a break every now and again. The mind has a tendency to make mistakes when you've exhausted yourself. In my case, I still seem to make mistakes even when I'm wide awake.\nByleth: Mistakes?\nMercedes: Oh, you know. I'm always mixing up the dates for drills or misplacing things. Just the other day, I forgot to put on my uniform and headed out to practice wearing only my — Oh, um. Well, you can imagine how embarrassed I was. My mind can be so scattered sometimes. Anyway... where was I? Ah, that's right. What I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't push yourself too hard. If you do, you might end up in a pretty bad place.\nMercedes: That reminds me! Is there anything I can do to assist you, Professor? If it's all right with you, I'd like to help in any way I can.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Thanks, I appreciate it.\nChoice 2: I'm not sure about that.\nMercedes:\nChoice 1 response: Whatever you need, just say the word.\nChoice 2 response: It'll be fine! I might be clumsy, but I'll get better over time.\nMercedes: I look forward to helping you out._Monk: You there, youngster. Won't you listen to this old man's troubles? I was born and raised right here in this town. I spent my whole life here. My daughter lives in the Empire, and she sent me a letter to ask if I was keeping up with my daily worship.\nByleth: ...\nMercedes: Well, hello there, Professor. Is this a friend of yours?\nByleth: I don't know him.\nMercedes: Is that so? I was sure you two knew each other. Is there something we can do for you, good sir?\nMonk: Oh, what a lovely young lady! I was just telling this kind soul a story.\nMercedes: Really? What's troubling you?\nMonk: Well, I was thinking of going to daily prayer, but my leg's been acting up and I can't walk properly.\nMercedes: How terrible! That's no good at all. May I be of assistance? I'd be happy to lend a shoulder and escort you to the chapel.\nMonk: Would you? Oh, I'd be most grateful to you. Thank the goddess for sending this young lady to me today!\nMercedes: We'll need your help too, Professor. Here, sir, take my arm.\n(Monk leaves)\n\nMercedes: Splendid work, Professor. He really seemed to appreciate our assistance.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: We did a good deed.\nChoice 2: You helped me out too.\nMercedes:\nChoice 2: I don't think I did anything particularly deserving of praise. I'm just happy that I could help. You did a great job cheering him up on your own!\nMercedes: Putting a smile on someone's face always seems to brighten up the day. Is something wrong? You're giving me a strange look.\nByleth: How did you know something was bothering him?\nMercedes: Oh. Hmm... How should I put this... I suppose it's just second nature to me.\nByleth: What do you mean?\nMercedes: It's difficult to describe, but I can usually tell when someone is worried about something. Back there, I could tell that both you and the old man were in distress. I spent a good amount of my life living in the church. Maybe that's why I'm so good at identifying these things?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Living in the church?\nChoice 2: That's news to me.\nMercedes: Did I not mention that before? I spent nearly 10 years of my life in the church of Faerghus. Many came to us with their troubles. In my own time of need, I once ran to the church myself, and they helped me. May I share something with you, Professor?\nByleth: What is your dream?\nMercedes: I'd like to work in the church one day. I want to be like the priest who helped me. Never mind. It's not a very realistic dream. Please, forget I said anything. If I were someone else, perhaps a commoner without a Crest or stature, maybe things would be different. It's a bit sad, but... this is the way things have to be. After all, only the goddess can decide our fates._Mercedes: Do you have a moment, Professor? I need to speak with you.\nMercedes: Thank you so much. This is what I wanted to address... This letter from my adoptive father just arrived.\nByleth: Adoptive father?\nMercedes: Oh! Have I not mentioned him? He's the reason I first came to the Officers Academy. He's also the one who dragged me from the church where I was living just so he could use my Crest.\nByleth: I don't understand...\nMercedes: My Crest does not yet belong to a house, so he plans to use it as leverage to marry into the nobility. He's a very greedy man who was a roving merchant before adopting me, but now he's in the capital. This letter says that he's finally arranged to marry me off to a wealthy noble. I know he's just thinking of himself, but can't he see that this isn't a priority when we're at war?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: My thoughts exactly.\nChoice 2: Maybe the war has pushed him to this?\nMercedes:\nChoice 1 response: n/a\nChoice 2 response: I suppose it's possible. He may be worried about carrying on his bloodline, but...\nMercedes: Ugh! I don't know what to do about this proposal!\nByleth: Will you accept?\nMercedes: I can't see any way around it, so I fear that I must... I just don't want to let go of the life that I've made for myself. I know it's not what my heart wants, but I don't have the strength to say no.\nByleth: What does your heart want?\nMercedes: I believe I've mentioned this before, but I want to work in service of the church. Well, I suppose it doesn't necessarily have to be the church, but I want to help those in need. If I were to marry a noble, I think it would be difficult to realize that dream...\nByleth: Why can't you decline?\nMercedes: It's just... I've always allowed myself to follow the whims of those above me. I convinced myself that everything in life was at the will of the goddess. I was blind to reality. I believed it was her will to both pull me from the church and guide me to the Officers Academy. The decision to enter this war was the first time I acted of my own free will. My adoptive father opposed this decision, but I somehow managed to convince him.\nMercedes: Still, I couldn't free myself of him completely. This letter is proof of that. It's not that I'm scared of him, but there is something that worries me...\nByleth: Severing your ties?\nMercedes: Ah! I knew you'd understand, Professor. I've sat down to write a reply several times, but I can't muster up the courage, or the words. I was hoping you could provide me with the encouragement I need!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Why reply at all?\nChoice 2: You can't just give up on your dreams.\nMercedes:\nChoice 1 response: If I don't, he'll go ahead with the arrangement! I suppose I must aim toward cutting him out of my life completely...\nChoice 2 response: That's a very good point! We're only given one life, so we must do all we can to pursue our happiness!\nMercedes: OK! I think that may have been just the push I was looking for! I'll tell him the truth. That I've found a life worth pursuing and I must decline the proposal! Maybe I should tell him I've fallen for someone else?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Fallen for someone else?\nChoice 2: Who might that be?\nMercedes: Why, it's you, Professor! Isn't that obvious?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Excuse me?\nChoice 2: I wouldn't say \"obvious\"...\nMercedes: I'm just teasing! Now, I'm off to write this letter and stand my ground! Thank you for your encouragement!_null_null_Mercedes: There you are! I apologize for the short notice, but I'm so glad you could make it! I'm sure you're very busy, being the hero of Fódlan and all.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Yes, very busy.\nChoice 2: I have some time.\nMercedes:\nChoice 1 response: Then I'm afraid that what I'm about to ask may come at an inopportune time.\nChoice 2 response: What a relief! I have to ask you something, but I'd hate to inconvenience you!\nMercedes: Do you mind hearing me out?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'll listen.\nChoice 2: I'd be happy to.\nMercedes: Ah! Great! Here it is...\nMercedes: I'm going to Fhirdiad to meet with my adoptive father, and I'd like you to accompany me.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: What for?\nChoice 2: Is it necessary for you to go?\nMercedes:\nChoice 1 response: I feel the need to set things straight with him in my own way.\nChoice 2 response: I want proper closure. I'm going to tell him face-to-face that this is farewell.\nMercedes: I've already decided exactly what I'm going to say. I'm choosing to live my life how I want, in pursuit of my own happiness. I need you to accept that. I'm in charge of my own destiny. Not you, not anyone else. Just me. Ah... I've waited so long to say all that.\nByleth: Why do you need me to accompany you?\nMercedes: That's a very good question... Where do I start? Remember when I teased that I'd fallen for you? The truth is... that wasn't entirely in jest. I fell for you some time ago. I fact, I'd very much like to spend my life with you. Of course, that's only if you'll have me...\nByleth: I had something similar in mind.\n(Byleth presents Jeralt's ring)\n\nMercedes: Oh my goodness!\nByleth: I love you, Mercedes. Let's get married.\nMercedes: Yes! Let's! You've no idea what this means to me. This may be the happiest I've ever been! I'm so glad I could finally express my feelings. Now we can live the rest of our lives together! To think, I was able to choose this path of my own volition, and now I get to walk it with you! Should one person be allowed this much happiness? But still, you're only given one life. Are you sure you want to spend it with me? I may be quite demanding at times as I'm intend on pursuing my dreams. I want to help those in need, wherever they may be. And I won't give up on that.\nByleth: I'll always support you.\nMercedes: I thought that's what you might say! Perhaps that's why I fell for you. It's just the way you are. All right, let's be off! It's no short journey to Fhirdiad. Oh, something to note...\nByleth: Yes?\n(Transition to S Support CG)\n\nMercedes: You should know that I can be quite scatterbrained. And clumsy... But I will do everything in my power to help and support you too, whatever you may need! What a wonderful life we will lead together...

33_39_Sylvain: Mercedes! You look divine, as always? Are you off to pray?\nMercedes: Oh, hello, Sylvain. I was just on my way to pray. How did you guess?\nSylvain: Well, because I've been watching your lovely-\nMercedes: Oh, I get it. You're the type who's always looking at girls, aren't you?\nSylvain: I won't lie. I do enjoy beholding women... But I don't mean it like that with you. I know I sound like a dope. I just-I think you're special.\nMercedes: Oh, really? You think I'm so clumsy that I need someone to watch over me? Is that why you can't take your eyes off me?\nSylvain: You're beautiful. And I mean that. You're... Uh, how can I put it without sounding even worse? OK, here goes... I want to get to know you better, as friends, I mean.\nMercedes: I don't know where to begin.\nSylvain: Well, what's something you like?\nMercedes: I like to pray. I've been praying regularly since I was a child.\nSylvain: You grew up in the Empire, didn't you?\nMercedes: That's right. I was raised in House Bartels.\nSylvain: Bartels? I thought you were born to House Martritz?\nMercedes: It's a complicated story. I'm not sure that it's a very interesting one, but I'm happy to share it with you.\nSylvain: I don't mean to be nosy...if it's too personal.\nMercedes: Oh, no. I don't mind. I wasn't trying to hide anything from you. House Martritz fell shortly before I was born.\nSylvain: Oh...\nMercedes: My father passed away while my mother was still pregnant with me, so she had nowhere to go. After I was born, my mother ended up marrying the head of House Bartels. Shortly after, my mother bore a true Bartels child who bore a Crest. She and I were treated as though we were no longer useful to the family after that.\nSylvain: You think the Bartels were just using her to secure a Crest?\nMercedes: They must have been. My mother and I were removed from the family and forced to flee to a church in the Kingdom. I abandoned the Bartels name and took up our old family name again.\nSylvain: So you grew up in a church. OK, it makes more sense now why you're praying all the time.\nMercedes: Yes, I-oh! Praying! I forgot that I was on my way to pray!\nSylvain: Right...and I interrupted you. Well, see you around, Mercedes.\nMercedes: Yes, see you!\nSylvain: House Bartels wanted a Crest and ruined other people's lives to get one. These idiots are all the same._Sylvain: Mercedes, I swear the whole cathedral glows with heavenly light when you're around.\nMercedes: Hello, Sylvain. What a treat to see you here. I thought you preferred places with more ladies around.\nSylvain: I'm here because you're here. And I don't care about other girls.\nMercedes: Oh, come now. I'm sure you use that line all the time.\nSylvain: Actually, I've only said it to girls who thought I was lying about being faithfu— You know what? There's no reason to get into all that. The truth is I would really like to spend some time with you. What do you say to that?\nMercedes: Well, if you were really interested in me, I would want you to get to know me better.\nSylvain: I agree. I've been such an idiot in the past, always angling for the seduction... I've forgotten how to just talk to someone.\nMercedes: You act like you're full of regret, but I know you don't really mean it. Still, I'm glad to hear you say that, at least. I told you such a boring story the last time we spoke... I was worried you might think I was a dull person.\nSylvain: Dull? No. I was worried that I'd made you remember unhappy times. It's horrible what you had to go through. It's not like anyone chooses to be born with a Crest.\nMercedes: Right. We can't choose our bloodline. You've got a Crest too, haven't you, Sylvain? What has your experience been like?\nSylvain: Are you asking me how being born with a Crest affected me? It's not a very happy story.\nMercedes: Please don't feel the need to hold back on my account. I'm here if you need someone to share in your pain.\nSylvain: Would you want to know more about me even if I didn't have a Crest or come from a noble family?\nMercedes: This has nothing to do with your Crest or family. I'm just asking as your friend. How should I put this? When I look at you, I don't see a Crest. I want to see the real you.\nSylvain: You...you do? Here's the short version-I hate Crests. Even though having one is supposed to be such a great blessing, mine has ruined everything. Miklan was heir to our house. Then I was born, and I became the heir because I had a Crest. That made my older brother jealous enough to want to kill me. And every woman in Fódlan wants to have my little Crest baby so they can join the nobility. Yeah... There you go. That's what it's like to have a Crest.\nMercedes: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to dredge up such awful things.\nSylvain: No, I...I should keep my temper better. I don't want you to see me act that way.\nMercedes: Don't say that. I'm glad we were able to talk. I feel like I'm finally seeing the real you. Oh, Sylvain. Will you save me from the curse of having a Crest.\nSylvain: Of course! I think I love you! And I mean that. With all my heart. I love you, Mercedes! Let's get married and have Crest babies!\nMercedes: Sure, sure._Sylvain: Mercedes! You're looking divine, as always.\nMercedes: Good evening, Sylvain! Thank you for coming out to see me.\nSylvain: Just the two of us meeting at this time of night? You move quicker than I thought.\nMercedes: Hmm? I don't know what speed has to do with it, but there was something I wanted to talk to you about.\nSylvain: Ah, OK... I probably should have figured that out.\nMercedes: I can be so forgetful at times. I neglected to mention this the other day. I meant to say... that I know you've been through a lot in life.\nSylvain: Huh? Me?\nMercedes: Your parents have placed a great deal of pressure on you as their heir... And it's all because you were born with a Crest. You've had to put up with such lofty expectations.\nSylvain: All the Kingdom's noble houses expect a lot from their heirs. I'm no different from any other noble guy or gal. We've all got responsibilities.\nMercedes: But didn't you mention that your brother envied you enough to wish you dead? I'm sure that wasn't easy.\nSylvain: Thinking about it, life was probably a lot harder for my brother than it ever has been for me.\nMercedes: Didn't you also mention that women were only interested in having your, as you say, \"Crest baby\"? I'm not very interested in the particulars, but... I get the feeling that you don't care very much for these women who throw themselves at you.\nSylvain: Um, I'd appreciate it if you maybe kept that observation between the two of us.\nMercedes: Your secret's safe with me. I understand the pain you've had to carry.\nSylvain: I know you've got your share of bad memories too, but...\nMercedes: That's why you feel comfortable letting your guard down around me. Come now, that's enough with the sad smile.\nSylvain: Mercedes... Was my sad smile really that bad? Did it ruin my dashing good looks?\nMercedes: Not at all. You actually look more handsome to me with honesty on your face.\nSylvain: Aw, here come the waterworks...\nMercedes: Don't be ashamed of crying. I'm here to protect you. Will you protect me in return?\nSylvain: I will. I promise. You know, Mercedes, you really are a special lady._null_null_null_
