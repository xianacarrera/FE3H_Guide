I mean...are you stumped? That makes me surprised! [+ Support]\nChoice 2 response: Thank you, Professor! I finally have understanding.\nPetra: Can I ask you about another word? The one that is written here... Hm? Is something on my face?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You're so enthusiastic\nChoice 2: I admire you.\nChoice 3: Your cheeks are on your face.\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: I am without much time to study. I must use my time with wisdom.\nChoice 2 response: Is that really what you are thinking? Or maybe you have curiosity about the mark on my face...\nChoice 3 response: Yes, I know about that! That is a joke of Fódlan! Right? [+ Support]\nPetra: Is that really what you are thinking? Or maybe you have curiosity about the mark on my face?\nByleth: The mark?\nPetra: You are already knowing that I am from Brigid. This is a mark from Brigid. It is a prayer to the forest spirits. A prayer to be protected. Hunters ask the forest spirits to have safe and bountiful hunting. There are many spirits in Brigid. I have more marks on my arms and back. They are prayers for my family's health and triumph. Are you wanting to see them?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I would love to.\nChoice 2: No, but thank you.\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: That gives me happiness. If there is ever the chance, you will see them. [+ Support]\nChoice 2 response: Oh. I have understanding.\nPetra: I have much gratitude for you, Professor. You always listen with patience. I can read and understand the language of Fódlan, but speak it... gives me difficulty. I hope I will keep having your support. And I will give you my support too, with my whole heart. I have things that I cannot fail to accomplish.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Let's do our best.\nChoice 2: Don't overdo it.\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: Yes. We will keep walking forward.\nChoice 2 response: Overdo... Yes. I will not overdo._Petra: Hiya! Hm? Professor?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It's very late...\nChoice 2: What are you doing?\nPetra: Please take my apologies. I lost time while I was training. There are not many chances for real fighting here. My body is more weak than it was. Weaker, I mean. I will keep training now. I hope your night is good!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You should get some rest.\nChoice 2: You're overdoing it.\nPetra: I need to have more training. There are things that I have not done yet. Things that have to be done. For the future, I have to try with hardness. Training, studying, socializing... I will not always be having time to do those things. And speaking the language of Fódlan... I worry I will never be doing it just right.\nByleth: Why do you try so hard?\nPetra: Why? Because... the position of Brigid is weak. Fódlan and Dagda are big. Brigid is a small island in the middle of them. Brigid has great beauty... but little power. We will not have... will not survive, unless we get more strength. I will lead Brigid, and so I have responsibility. I have to have more strength than anyone.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It doesn't have to be that way.\nChoice 2: Perhaps you're right.\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: Having more strength than anyone might be un... impossible. But I have to give it my best try.\nChoice 2 response: Yes. That is why I have to give it my best try.\nPetra: I am an ally of everyone, and I have belonging at the Officers Academy. That is also why I try with hardness. You can always be counting me. I mean... counting on me. But you should know that one of these days will be when I return to Brigid. Before that day, do not try stopping me from trying. And please, keep watch... watching over me. With you, I can try with more hardness than I could alone._Petra: Professor... Please do not be concerned. I just did too much overworking and lost my strength.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Are you OK?\nChoice 2: You were overdoing it...\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: Yes! I have no problems. Accept my apology for giving you worry.\nChoice 2 response: Yes... That is the truth. Please accept my apology.\nPetra: I have sorrow... I mean, I am sorry to be fainting at a time like this. Even though I was not asking for your care and attention, you gave it willingly...\nByleth:\nChoice 1: It was the least I could do.\nChoice 2: You must stop pushing yourself too hard.\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: I am thinking that is incorrect...\nChoice 2 response: Um...\nPetra: Will you have a listen to me? There is something that I must be saying. I am thinking you already have knowledge of why I came to Fódlan... Not for studying but as a hostage for the Empire, so that Brigid would not be rebelling anymore. It feels like...a knife against my throat. That I am making my grandfather obey the Empire.\nPetra:\nBlack Eagles route: Because I am a hostage, it is not an option to be giving up. I must be fighting and winning and staying alive. I must do anything to be making life better for Brigid. To be making Brigid and the Empire stand as equals.\nOther routes: If I were running away from the Empire, then Brigid would be defeated. I am not having any options. To be living, I must be fighting to win... For Brigid to be living, the Empire needs to be crushed. So I must be crushing the Empire.\nPetra: That is what my people are wanting from me...and what my grandfather, the king of Brigid, is wanting!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: And what do you want?\nChoice 2: You must take care of yourself to succeed.\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: My want? I...I am not knowing of that. The wants of my people are something I have power to achieve. Their wants are my own.\nChoice 2 response: That is a truth. I wonder what I should be doing... I want to be granting the wants of my tribe... So, their wants are my own, correct?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Only you can know what you want.\nChoice 2: If that's how you really feel...\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: What I really want...\nChoice 2 response: How I really feel...\nPetra: I have understanding. Wait... No, I...I actually do not have understanding. Yet. What I am understanding is that there is something I am not understanding. When I know what my true want is, I give you my promise that I will be telling you first._null_null_Petra: We really had success! We got the victory! The war is finished now! But...there are still many, many problems for solving. I... It is past the time I should be returning to Brigid.\nByleth: You're going back home?\nPetra: Yes. My grandfather... I...I can't be leaving him now. Our relationship with Fódlan will be changing. I am royalty of Brigid. There are duties that I must be fulfilling. But...I can't be sitting on the throne. I will be choosing a new leader, and then I will be returning to Fódlan. This is what my heart is wanting.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: So...that's what YOU want, then?\nChoice 2: What about Brigid?\nPetra:\nChoice 1 response: Yes! I am meaning...no? I will try to speak with more precision... If I were staying away from Fódlan, then I could not be having what I am wanting.\nChoice 2 response: There are others who can be working in Brigid. I will always be protecting my land of home, but from Fódlan. This is where I have belonging. If Fódlan and Brigid can be working together, then I can maybe have what I am really wanting...\nPetra: And that is... I will be telling you now if you are wanting to hear it... I am wanting to...to stay with you. I have hopes that we can spend all of our lives close to each other. I want us to be supporting each other and live with each other...in times of joy and times of sorrow. In all of the times. Is that... Is that a possibility?\nByleth: Petra... this is for you.\nPetra: This is...a ring of promise. I have understanding! And I am accepting with all of my heart! Rings are for promising weddings! I read all about that custom from a Fódlan book! I have never told my feelings to someone like that before. I had so much nervousness! You have made my heart fly with happiness... I, Petra, give you my promise! Spirits of Earth, please be guiding us home for all of our days. Spirits of Water, please be filling our cups with kindness and good fortune. Spirits of Wind, please be gifting us freedom and divine protection. Those are the words we are saying in Brigid when we give someone our promise.\nByleth: I give you my promise too. I love you, Petra.\nPetra: There is one other thing to be said...\nByleth: Yes?\nPetra: My beloved... You are the most precious thing in the world to me. You enchant and fascinate me, and each day, you set my heart aflame.\nByleth: Petra... That was beautiful.\nPetra: Did I give you a surprise? I have been practicing those words with great diligence. I am...so happy, You have my deep gratitude... and all of my heart. For now and forever.

34_38_Petra: Shamir. You are training away from the ground of training.\nShamir: Ah. Petra. Well, it looks like it might rain.\nPetra: I have understanding. Rain training can cause unhealthiness. Can I give you a question now?\nShamir: Sure.\nPetra: You come from Dagda, I think. Why are you working at the monastery?\nShamir: You can tell I'm from Dagda? Ah, I suppose Brigid is our neighbor. As for why I work here, that's simple. I work to live. Rhea took me in when I had nowhere else to go. I'm here to repay my debt. I don't plan to return to Dagda any time soon.\nPetra: But, Fódlan is an enemy for you, right? Are you feeling OK about that?\nShamir: The only ones I've fought in person are the Imperial army. I carry no ill will toward anyone else.\nPetra: I have gratitude for your answering. You have given me understanding.\nShamir: How about you? Do you hate them? The Empire is your father's enemy, no? And it's Dagda's fault that Brigid got pulled into the war at all... So, do you hate Dagda? Or do you see that as none of your concern?\nPetra: The fault is not of Dagda. My father made his own choice to be joining the war. I cannot say I have no hatred for the Empire, but I do not have any for Edelgard. When I came here, she was always helping me.\nShamir: Makes sense. You can hate a country without hating its people.\nPetra: You speak with such honesty. It is very amazing.\nShamir: I'm not that special. I just don't let emotions get in my way._Petra: Shamir. Can I be having your time? There is a thought that is giving me great concern.\nShamir: Let's hear it, Petra.\nPetra: If Dagda is ever invading Fódlan again, what will you be doing?\nShamir: Hah. I'd join the army of Dagda. I'd lay waste to Fódlan, and return to my homeland.\nPetra: If that is the truth, then I am having one more question for you. If that was happening, and all of us were fighting for Fódlan...would you be fighting your allies in the Imperial army too?\n(Alternative, if playing Azure Moon or Verdant Wind) ...would you be fighting us too?\n\nShamir: Of course. You expect me to die for you? You should be prepared to do the same. Your homeland would likely join Dagda.\nPetra: So, that is your truth...\nShamir: Maybe...if you'd asked me five years ago.\nPetra: Hm?\nShamir: I've been a mercenary since childhood. Always fighting for a bounty. If my allies didn't pay, I'd side with the enemy. It's why I became a sniper. Easier to dispose of anyone with a reward on their head. It's also why I joined the Knights of Seiros. I owned them a debt. But that's all changed.\nPetra: You are not fighting for money now?\nShamir: That's right. When I see everyone fighting for Fódlan, I feel inclined to help. I won't die for the cause, but I will protect everyone. If the army of Dagda engaged you, I'd fight at your side.\nPetra: Hearing that is giving...it gives me great joy. Until the war is finished, let us fight together._null_null_null_null_
