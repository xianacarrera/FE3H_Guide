35_41_Raphael: Hngh... Hngh... Hngh... Ungh... Hngh... Hngh... Phew... Oh, Professor! Are you here to train?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I came to train.\nChoice 2: I came to check on you.\nRaphael:\nChoice 1 response: I knew it! Gotta train daily.\nChoice 2 response: You should join me. Training is more important than worrying about me.\nRaphael: Legs, back, chest, arms, abs. Gotta work 'em all, right? I just finished training and I feel great. Check me out! Are my muscles bulging?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I guess so?\nChoice 2: I'm not sure about that.\nRaphael: Another day of training and my muscles are ready to burst! Bulging muscles mean strength. I have to be strong if I want to be a proper knight. And I have to eat if I wanna keep training. Time to feast!\nByleth: Isn't studying also important for a knight?\nRaphael: Ah, way to hit me where it hurts, Professor. I know I'd be in big trouble if I don't train my brain too. Anyone who can't get tactics, can't be a proper knight. It's just... I'm no good at remembering that kind of stuff. And train my brain instead of my body makes me sleepy! What if I start training twice as hard? Then I should only have to study half as much, right?\nByleth: You'll never be a proper knight if you don't study.\nRaphael: You really think so? I can't let that happen! I guess I have no choice. I'll prove I can do it! Wish me luck, Professor! For my training and for my studies!_Raphael: Great timing, Professor! I was just going to come find you.\nByleth: ...\nRaphael: Are you busy? I have a question about formations. I don't understand them at all. Are the speed of battle and the terrain connected somehow? There's too much to memorize!\nByleth: You don't have to remember everything.\nRaphael: I don't? Then what do I have to know? I think I understand the basics. To start, you just...\n(Fade to black.)\nRaphael: Ah! OK. I think I've got it! Thanks for the help, Professor! Brains and brawn, you've really got it all. With your help, I should have no trouble becoming a proper knight!\nByleth: Why do you want to be a knight?\nRaphael: Huh? Didn't I tell you? My parents were merchants of the Alliance. They died in an accident. That's why it's up to me to look after my little sis. I'm not great with bookkeeping, so I didn't think I'd make a good merchant. I talked to Grandpa and he suggested I become a knight. So I sold all our valuables and used the money to pay my way into the academy. My sis won't survive if I get kicked out, so I can't give up now!\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Had you no other options?\nChoice 2: Did you consider becoming a mercenary?\nRaphael: I might have tried being a mercenary if I didn't have my little sis to look after. I probably shouldn't say this, but being a mercenary does sound like an easier life. Mercenaries have no responsibilities, and no one else to worry about. But someone's gotta take care of my little sis, so that's out of the question. Serving as a knight in a noble house is more secure, and you don't have to worry about dying...unless there's a war. My sis has been through so much. I don't want her to have to worry about me. Hey. Do you have any siblings, Professor?\nByleth: No.\nRaphael: Then you probably think I'm missing out on my freedom, having to support her, huh? But, working hard for my sister isn't too bad. Call it a burden, call it a challenge. If it makes my sister happy, I'm happy too! You should ask your father to have some more kids! Anyway, that's why I've got to become a proper knight!_Raphael: Hey, Professor! I think you've been working too much lately. The battle's gonna keep going with or without you, but you're the one doing the most out there! It's real impressive how you can focus on giving orders and fighting! I don't think I could do both in the same battle. I see you running all over the place, even after the battle is over. I just don't want you to wear yourself out.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'll be OK.\nChoice 2: Maybe I am tired.\nRaphael:\nChoice 1 response: Oh yeah? As soon as you say you're fine, that's when it hits you.\nChoice 2 response: You gotta take a break when you can. Even when you're feeling fine, it can suddenly hit you!\nRaphael: No offense, Professor, but don't you think some folks might be taking advantage of you? Claude keeps asking you to do things, but you never say no. Like when you gave that speech to the troops. That didn't seem like something you wanted to do. I know you gotta follow orders on the battlefield, but you should have to do things off the battlefield if you don't wanna.\nByleth: You've done things you don't want to do.\nRaphael: What do you mean? Like studying? Sure it's not my favorite thing in the world, but that was to keep my little sis fed. I had good reason for it.\nByleth: It's the same for me.\nRaphael: The same, huh? I think I get what you mean. You do things you don't wanna do for the sake of everyone else. That's real noble of you, Professor. I guess I can't get in your way if you're doing it for the right reason. OK, then. I'm gonna keep trying to do my best, but now I'm gonna do it for you. My little sis is important to me, but you're real important too. I always work hard for the people who matter to me. And having more of them in my life just means I gotta work even harder! What do you think?\nByleth: I think you're important to me too, Raphael.\nRaphael: Really?! I wasn't expecting you to say that! You're gonna make me blush! We gotta keep working hard together then. At least until this war's over. I'll work hard to make sure you don't collapse from exhaustion! You've got nothing to worry about, Professor. I've been training nonstop. I got your back, no matter what!_null_null_null_

Even you need a break every once in a while! The war's finally over, but they're still putting you to work, huh? I betcha it's going to get pretty busy from here on out.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Probably.\nChoice 2: Who knows.\nRaphael: Fódlan sure has changed a lot since you were our professor. Some places that lost their leaders...and other ones got wrecked from all the fighting. You gotta decide what to do about the church now too, huh?\nByleth: You have a good grasp of the situation.\nRaphael: Hahaha! Even I understand that much! I'd never become a great knight if I didn't!\nByleth: You still want to become a knight?\nRaphael: You bet I do! That's what I've been working toward all this time! I'm not sure you heard, but apparently the battles I fought in made me famous! Folks started calling me \"the Beast of Leicester.\" Can you believe that? People calling me a Beast! I was offended at first, but my little sis said it made me sound tough. She must be right, 'cause I've had people asking me to work for them nonstop! I've made my decision though. I know whose knight I wanna be. Speaking of... I got this for you. Will you accept it?\nByleth: ...\nRaphael: Ma...m-m-ma-- Marry me and let me be your knight! Please! Remember how I told you how important you are to me? Well, I wanna be with you and stay by your side! I thought maybe if we got married, then we could always be together.\nByleth: What about your sister?\nRaphael: It's awfully nice of you to worry about her, but she'll be fine. I barely took my eye off her and she grew up into an adult! It won't be easy, but I want her to do whatever's gonna make her happy. I'll still keep an eye on her, but she'll be off on her own soon. I guess what I'm saying is, don't worry about her. She'll be OK. I'm more worried about you! You gotta rebuild this world from scratch! That's a whole lotta weight for one person to carry. Enough to crush you. So, will you let me help you? It's a heavy load, but I wanna carry it with you. What do you say? Will you let me be your knight?\nByleth: I will. I love you, Raphael.\nRaphael: You...love me? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! From now on and for the rest of forever, this Beast is gonna stay by your side! But wait. I can't just be a physically strong Beast. I gotta have a strong mind too! Whatever you need, I'll work as hard as I can! As hard as anyone! I'll keep training to make sure you can count on me. And...I'll love you. Forever and ever. And ever!
35_38_Raphael: Ugh...\nShamir: What's wrong with you?\nRaphael: Huh?! Uh, Shamir? How long have you been there?\nShamir: Too long. You're blocking my way.\nRaphael: W-wait! There's something I wanted to ask you.\nShamir: Ask? I... just make it quick.\nRaphael: Well, you see, wherever I go into battle, the enemy seems to find me right away. I'm an easy target, but I wanna be able to move around the battlefield without being noticed, like you do! So whaddya think? Would it be possible?\nShamir: Do you think you're being noticed because of your size?\nRaphael: Of course! I'm pretty hard to miss, you know? I thought that was obvious.\nShamir: Wrong. It's not your size, it's your presence. It's strong. Almost unbearably so.\nRaphael: My \"presence\"? Is that something I can change?\nShamir: With practice. Maybe. Let me ask you, have you ever felt my presence?\nRaphael: Now that I think about it, I haven't! That must be why I didn't notice you earlier. But how can I do that? Will you teach me? Please? Please!\nShamir: Fine. There's a breathing technique that masks your presence. When you breathe, are you continuously inhaling, then exhaling?\nRaphael: Well, of course. That's the best way I know how. I'd explode if I only breathed in!\nShamir: Right. To minimize your presence, breathe in, then out, then out again. In through the nose, then gently out through the mouth, twice.\nRaphael: In-out-out? That's it? I can definitely do that! (attempts) I-I couldn't do it, Shamir!\nShamir: Breathe less. Keep it to the absolute minimum.\nRaphael: I don't know the minimum!\nShamir: It'll take some practice.\nRaphael: Sure, sure. I'll keep trying. In-out-out is trickier than it sounds..._(Entrance Hall)\n\nRaphael: ... ... My breath!\nShamir: Careful. You're going to make yourself pass out.\nRaphael: Sh-Shamir? I'm so sorry, I...\nShamir: Are you trying to breathe like I showed you? Not even close.\nRaphael: That in-out-out technique sounds so easy, but it's not easy at all!\nShamir: It's only easy for me because I put in the time to practice. You need to practice if you want it to work.\nRaphael: Oh yeah? Really? So I should be able to do it if I just practice?\nShamir: Yes.\nRaphael: I see, I see. You had...no presence... Again...\nShamir: Yes, sometimes my presence fades without even trying. It can be a nuisance.\nRaphael: One of these days, I'm gonna do it. Just...like...you...\nShamir: Seems unlikely, but keep practicing.\nRaphael: Y-yeah... Got it... Thanks...\nShamir: Stop doing it while you're talking. It's disturbing._(Entrance Hall)\n\nRaphael: Shamir.\nShamir: Gah! Raphael?\nRaphael: All right! That went better than I thought! You make funny sounds when you're scared.\nShamir: I wasn't scared. Forget that happened. Still, I'm impressed. You managed to sneak up on me. Not many can do that.\nRaphael: It's 'cause I practiced that in-out-out breathing you showed me! I practiced until I passed out! It was worth it though. I've been able to get real close to enemies without them noticing! I think I pretty much got it figured out. Sneaking up on you is a good sign!\nShamir: True. To be honest, I didn't think you had it in you. I never thought you'd be able to suppress that unbearably palpable presence of yours. I respect anyone who could learn so much in such a short period of time. You might even be ready for a recon mission.\nRaphael: Recon? With you? And me? Together?\nShamir: Why the surprise? I said you were ready.\nRaphael: Wow! I never thought I'd get to go scouting with you! I guess that practice really is paying off!\nShamir: Heh.\nRaphael: Whoa! Was--was that a smile?\nShamir: Calm down, Raphael. Are you really that excited to go with me? Your presence may have dimmed, but your emotions are hitting me like a tidal wave.\nRaphael: Oh! Sorry! Is there a way to breathe and hide those too?\nShamir: No. That requires different training...from someone else. I'll keep you informed about the recon mission.\nRaphael: OK! Great! Looking forward to it!_(Outside)\n\nShamir: Mission complete. We're done here.\nRaphael: Let's report back.\n(Training Room)\n\nShamir: Well done out there, Raphael.\nRaphael: Did I do good? My presence wasn't too leaky or anything?\nShamir: You weren't perfect... But you were good enough. The enemy didn't notice you, and that's all that counts. You should do well in battle too.\nRaphael: Aww yeah! Thanks for taking me on the mission with you, Shamir! Now, how can I repay you?\nShamir: Please. There's no need.\nRaphael: Aww, come on! Don't be like that! I swear, I'll do whatever I can to--\nShamir: OK. If you insist, then go back to the way you were. That's enough for me.\nRaphael: I don't get it.\nShamir: You're now able to go undetected on the battlefield, but usually you--\nRaphael: Ah! I know! I spend too much energy trying to hide my presence. I gotta train more so it comes naturally!\nShamir: I was actually going to suggest the opposite. Your presence is a comfort to your allies. I am also more comfortable knowing that you are around.\nRaphael: Really? If that's how you feel, then we gotta stick together! We can eat meals together, train together, hang out together, or--\nShamir: No. No, no, no. I mean...that won't be necessary.\nRaphael: Oh. All right. I guess I'll leave you alone, then...\nShamir: That's...not what I meant either. I won't stop you if you wish to continue working with me. Let's do recon again sometime.\nRaphael: Really? That's great! I can't wait! _A+_null_
