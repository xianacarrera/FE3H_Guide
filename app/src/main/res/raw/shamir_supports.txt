38_41_Shamir: Hey, Professor. The students seem to like you.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Not that much.\nChoice 2: It would seem that way.\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: It doesn't make sense. You don't come across as particularly friendly.\nChoice 2 response: Hah! And you're not modest about it. I like that.\nShamir: Still, I can't deny that you've got skills. It's a little strange, to be completely honest. I had my doubts, but they were right to make you a professor.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I was surprised too.\nChoice 2: I knew I could do it.\nChoice 3: I'm still not sure...\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: I'd be suspicious of their true intentions, if I were you... Seems like it turned out just fine for you.\nChoice 2 response: Oh? You're an odd one. But what's it matter? Seems like it turned out just fine for you.\nChoice 3 response: Regardless, seems like it turned out fine for you.\nShamir: I'll admit, it's unbelievable that you used to be a mercenary. I was a merc before coming here, but I can't imagine pulling off your fancy tactician act. I freeze up near royals and nobles.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: You were a mercenary?\nChoice 2: You're not a fan of nobles?\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: I was. My family had nothing when I was growing up. There were too many mouths to feed, so I left. Joined up with some mercs for the pay. The work suited me, but I never liked having to bow and scrape to our noble employers.\nChoice 2 response: You deal with a lot of nobles when you're a merc. I didn't mind putting my life on the line, but I never liked having to bow and scrape to our noble employers.\nShamir: That's what I like about being a Knight. I get to punch all the nobles I want. Hah! I'm joking. But the knights do make a good business partner.\nByleth: Business partner?\nShamir: I don't believe in the Church of Seiros. It makes me a bit of an anomaly among the knights. Rhea took me in, so I became a knight to repay my debt to her. I may be a knight, but it still feels like I'm doing the same things I did as a merc.\nIf \"Sword and Shield of Seiros\" hasn't been completed: Who knows though? Maybe you and I will end up working together.\nIf \"Sword and Shield of Seiros\" has been completed: Who knows though? Maybe you and I will end up working together again, like at Derdriu.\nShamir: Us knights are a pretty tough crew... I'm guessing you'd run circles around us though. I'm interested to see where your path leads you._Shamir: Thanks for your help out there. Battles tend to go smoother with you around.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: The same to you.\nChoice 2: Smoother?\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: Heh. I think you did most of the heavy lifting.\nChoice 2 response: I can count on you doing most of the heavy lifting.\nShamir: It may be unwise to think this way on the battlefield... But I feel I can trust your commands without question.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Why's that?\nChoice 2: I still make mistakes.\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: Not sure. I might have an idea, but... Never mind.\nChoice 2 response: Don't we all? But, judging by the results of our recent battles, you're clearly good at this.\nShamir: I've also noticed that you've been putting me in more precarious situations lately. Almost like you know I won't question your orders.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: My apologies for that.\nChoice 2: I know I can rely on you.\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: No need.\nChoice 2 response: Hah!\nShamir:\n(Crimson Flower) I'm glad you trust me to get the job done, but still... I knew you were doing it on purpose. You're in a very important position, now that you're leader of the Imperial army. Funny to think you used to just teach at the Officers Academy. Your old students still call you \"Professor.\" That's no title for the commander of an army.\n(Other Routes) I'm glad you trust me to get the job done, but still... I knew you were doing it on purpose. You're in a very important position, now that you're leading the charge against the Empire. Funny to think you used to just teach at the Officers Academy. Your old students still call you \"Professor.\" That's no title for the commander of an army.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: There's no harm in it.\nChoice 2: I actually like it.\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: Relax. I was just having fun.\nChoice 2 response: You'll always be their professor, huh?\nShamir: You sure are an interesting one. My people lost the war and I was left to wander F贸dlan alone, but I guess meeting you was my prize. You look confused. Did you not know any of this? I was living in my homeland of Dagda, up until the Imperial army destroyed it 10 years ago. But, being a mercenary, I have no real allegiance. That's why I'm working here now. Don't worry though. I don't plan to turn on you._Shamir: It's been 10 years... Can I move on yet? Never mind. I know what you'd say.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: Were you talking to someone?\nChoice 2: What are you doing here?\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: In a sense. Someone who's long since passed.\nChoice 2 response: I was just thinking about someone I used to know.\nShamir: Another mercenary I fought alongside. They were killed ten years ago when Dagda was in conflict with the Empire. It's all I can focus on lately...\nByleth: Why do you think that is?\nShamir: To be honest, I blame you. Heh. I'm just teasing. I know it's not your fault. You just remind me of him. You give off a similar air... It's uncanny. You even have the same inflection, which makes no sense because we only ever spoke Dagdan. I don't know what it is, but you feel the same to me. I guess you just remind me of the past.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I'm sorry.\nChoice 2: I can't really help it...\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: Please.\nChoice 2 response: That's fair.\nShamir: It's not your fault. It's my fault for getting caught up in memories. Still, you always remember your first love, right? That's enough of that. There are more relevant topics to discuss.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: I suppose.\nChoice 2: What will you do after the war?\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: There's no point in dwelling on the past. Let's talk about the future.\nChoice 2 response: Good question. The world is completely open to me.\nShamir: Your next move seems apparent... But...who knows where I'll end up. Though, I may have done enough traveling for one lifetime. I like the idea of having a permanent home. And after all my time here, I've grown quite fond of F贸dlan._null_null_Shamir: Sorry for making you wait. Negotiations went long.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That took forever.\nChoice 2: Negotiations?\nShamir:\nChoice 1 response: Hah. Not curious about the contract? They wanted me to stay on as a mercenary, but I said no.\nChoice 2 response: Nothing to worry about. They tried convincing me to stay on as a mercenary, but I said no.\nShamir: I've been considering a different kind of commitment instead. Less of a contract, more of a promise.\nByleth: I'd like that.\nShamir: Good. I thought you might want to follow F贸dlan tradition and exchange rings. Right. That's that. Shall we be off?\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That was quick.\nChoice 2: Is there anything else?\nShamir: What's wrong? Were you expecting more? We've been fighting together for so long. No need for words. I've said enough... Right?\nByleth: This is a special occasion!\nShamir: I can see this is important to you... Fine then. I vow to stay with you through all of life's many hardships. I will stay by your side, and you'll stay by mine. I left Dagda, crossed through Brigid, and came to F贸dlan on my own. I chose the life of a mercenary, alone and free to live wherever and however I pleased... Now I'm choosing to remain here, to live the rest of my life...with you. Is that enough? Now I'm just embarrassed.\nByleth:\nChoice 1: That was...wonderful.\nChoice 2: I'm embarrassed too...\nShamir: Look at us! We have no idea what to do with ourselves. But you're right. This is a special day. Now then. Are you ready to go?\nByleth: Let's stay a little longer.\nShamir: Fine. We can stay. I've already made a fool of myself. No point in trying to avoid it now. So, what else is there to talk about? Oh, right. Remember when I mentioned how much you have in common with my old partner? I don't think that's actually true. I didn't want to admit that I was attracted to you, so I convinced myself that I was just pining for the past. I was worried that revealing those feelings would ruin our friendship...\nShamir: Anyway. It's your turn to talk. Tell me about your past.\nByleth: There isn't much to tell...\nShamir: Hmph. You're lucky I love you, otherwise I wouldn't let you get away with an answer like that.
